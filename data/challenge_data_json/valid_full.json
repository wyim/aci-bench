Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.\n\nMr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.\n\nThe patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nNewly diagnosed pituitary lesion.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo known family history; adopted.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployment Status: Works as a computer programmer.\nMarital Status: Married for 25 years.\nLiving Arrangement: Lives with wife, recently purchased a new house.\nAlcohol Use: None.\nTobacco Use: Non-smoker.\nRecreational Drugs: None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeurological\nPatient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent. Cranial nerve examination grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities.\n\nEyes\nVisual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.\n\nRESULTS\n\nLabs reviewed, 03/03/2021: CBC, U&Es, coagulation, and CRP are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal.\n\nIndependent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Pituitary adenoma\n\u2022 Bitemporal hemianopia\n\nMr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.\n\nPLAN\n\nPituitary adenoma.\nWe discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma.\n\nBitemporal hemianopia.\nWe will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n\u2022 Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing.\n\u2022 Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.\n",

did you wake up with it ?\n[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .\n[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?\n[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .\n[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?\n[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .\n[doctor] okay . i see .\n[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .\n[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?\n[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .\n[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?\n[patient] yes . with eating .\n[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?\n[patient] mm-hmm . i did .\n[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?\n[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .\n[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .\n[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .\n[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?\n[patient] they're normal .\n[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?\n[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .\n[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?\n[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .\n[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?\n[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .\n[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ?

            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nEsophagitis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBetty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of suspected esophagitis. The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.\n\nThe patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.\n\nThe patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nUterine fibroids.\nAnemia.\n\nSurgical\nCholecystectomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNone reported.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022\u202fCardiovascular:\u202f Positive for chest pain.\n\u2022\u202fGastrointestinal:\u202f Positive for difficulty swallowing.\n\u2022\u202fPsychiatric:\u202f Positive for stress.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\nMild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe patient\u2019s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nThe patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient\u2019s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.\n\nNon-cardiac chest pain.\n\nSuspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.\n\nPLAN\n\n\u2022 We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD. The patient is agreeable to this plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n\u2022 Self-monitor for symptom recurrence and notify my office if this occurs.\n\u2022 Follow up as needed.",

She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow\u2019s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy.

stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen\n[doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right\n[patient] it's my right one of course\n[doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before\n[patient] no i have not\n[doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain\n[patient] gosh it's like a nine\n[doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it\n[patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] really\n[doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen\n[patient] this happened yesterday morning\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just not it's really bad\n[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry\n[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally\n[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere\n[patient] no not really\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just really along my wrist\n[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling\n[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling\n[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well\n[patient] yeah it does\n[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like\n[patient] not without extreme pain\n[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up\n[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually\n[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] alright and then lateral as well\n[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason\n[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist\n[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight\n[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you\n[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all\n[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down\n[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better\n[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] pardon what\n[patient] a what\n[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace\n[patient] okay thank you\n[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay\n[patient] when do i have to have the surgery\n[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to

            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight wrist injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDiana Scott is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right wrist injury. The patient sustained this injury yesterday morning, 05/12/2022, when she slipped on the stairs while carrying a laundry basket. She states she tried to catch herself with her arms outstretched. The patient reports an immediate onset of pain and swelling in her right wrist. She denies any previous injuries to her right arm. The patient rates her pain level as a 9/10. Her pain is aggravated by movement. The patient also reports numbness and tingling in her fingers. She has been icing and wrapping her right wrist with an ACE wrap. The patient has also been taking ibuprofen, which provides some relief. She notes fully extending her arm while resting it on a pillow alleviates some of her pain as well.\n\nThe patient is going on vacation in 1 month.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right wrist pain and swelling.\nNeurological: Reports numbness and tingling to the digits of the right hand.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood Pressure: Elevated at 140/70 mmHg.\nHeart Rate: 80 beats per minute.\nRespiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute.\nBody Temperature: 97.2 degrees F.\nHEAD: Normocephalic\nNECK: No swelling noted\nCV: No bilateral lower extremity edema. No carotid bruit. No murmurs, gallops or rubs heard during auscultation of the heart. Palpabale pulses to the bilateral lower extremities.\nRESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nGI/GU: Non-distended\nBACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity\nNECK: No adenopathy. No thyromegaly.\nMSK: Examination of the right wrist: Limited range of movement. Tenderness to palpation. Pain on flexion and extension. Pain with radial deviation and lateral deviation. Pain with wrist abduction and adduction. The metacarpals are intact. Obvious swelling and bruising. Tenderness on palpation throughout. There is evidence of potential fracture feeling and bony crepitus.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight wrist Colles fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.\n\nIn the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress.\n",

would say that when i'm stationary i do n't really feel a lot of pain but if i start doing some mobility i would say probably a four five\n[doctor] about a four okay and how long ago did you say this was is this happened this injury\n[patient] it's been a week now\n[doctor] a week okay alright alright so we will take a look i'll do a physical exam of your knee in a second but i do want to check up you do have a past medical history of hypertension i'm seeing here you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly\n[patient] yes i have\n[doctor] okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that\n[patient] i definitely need some help there i have not have not made some some changes\n[doctor] okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today\n[patient] no\n[doctor] are you any belly pain\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no shortness of breath just wan na make sure\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so i'm just gon na listen to your lungs here your

day that should also help with the the swelling of your knee for your hypertension now i'm gon na keep you on that twenty of lisinopril okay because you are taking it and you you're doing pretty good with it i also want to get you a referral to nutrition just to try to help you with that diet you know because right now you are your diet is little bit out of control so we just need to rain you in a

feels better trying to drink lots of fluids\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] to see if it can it you know the dry coughing if it's part of that or what i can do\n[doctor] okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there\n[patient] no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would\n[doctor] okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems\n[patient] the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong\n[doctor] okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone\n[patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me\n[doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue\n[patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming\n[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far\n[patient] that sounds great thank you\n[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss\n[patient] great\n[doctor] okay any questions for me\n[patient] i do n't believe so at this time\n[doctor] okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit\n[patient] great thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome and so now just",

abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today\n[patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding\n[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me\n[patient] yeah that's a mouthful\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here\n[doctor] i'll do this\n[patient] i i think i would break that\n[doctor] yeah i just saw that\n[patient] if you can do that\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up\n[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me\n[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections\n[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual\n[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections\n[doctor] diarrhea no\n[patient] frequently\n[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of\n[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies\n[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy\n[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions\n[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes\n[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street\n[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes\n[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that\n[doctor] i know i know\n[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away\n[doctor] right\n[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products\n[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally\n[patient] okay where did you go\n[doctor] i was in zambia\n[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful\n[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time\n[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial\n[doctor] no\n[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you\n[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried\n[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea\n[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and\n[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency\n[doctor] why is that\n[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency\n[doctor] okay okay thank you\n[patient] you're welcome\n[doctor] okay",

I have explained to him that the results of his recent lab work is consistent with an IgA deficiency. I have recommended that we obtain additional blood work to check his other antibodies. I encouraged the patient to be aware of lingering infections or abdominal changes including diarrhea. If he experiences these issues, he should report them to my office so we may investigate further, however I do not believe there is a need for that at this time. In the meantime, he should report this IgA deficiency in the event that he needs any blood transfusions. Questions were invited and answered today.",

            "src": "[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that\n[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it\n[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics\n[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left\n[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now\n[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point\n[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that\n[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc\n[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park\n[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now\n[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there\n[patient] i do n't feel that right there\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure\n[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture\n[doctor] correct\n[patient] if i heard\n[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy\n[patient] okay sounds good\n[doctor] alright",

The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 6 weeks ago, after wearing a pair of shoes that were too tight.\n\nToday, he describes a burning, stinging, and throbbing sensation. The patient reports a blister on the pad of the plantar aspect of his foot around his heel. He explains that he has been ambulating on the anterior aspect of his foot. He explains that the top part of the skin of the blister detached, which revealed a thick, soft, mushy skin associated with unpleasant smell and yellow drainage. The patient called his primary care physician, who referred him to our office. He was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics approximately 6 days ago. He experienced chills and a fever of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient denies any nausea or vomiting. He states that when he started the antibiotics, his foot began to feel pretty good. However, he has now noticed that his foot has turned black around the outside of the wound, and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle as well. He also reports a burning red streak that was coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle. While palpating his calf, he has noted stiffness in the muscle that is now up to the patella. The patient reports that he has been coughing a lot over the last 2 days. He has experienced shortness of breath with ambulation around the house. He reports that he purchases new diabetic shoes yearly and changes the inserts every 3 to 4 months.\n\nThe patient is diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy. He explains that his blood sugar has been trending in the 300 to 400's over the last 2 weeks. At one point, he had a blood sugar spike to either 500 or 600. He states that his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.7, which has been his average for approximately 2 years. The patient checks his blood sugar 2 to 3 times per day and rarely has a blood sugar that goes over 200. He explains that he used to be on an insulin pump and had an A1c that at one point was 13. He states that he worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it is now.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports a history of diabetic neuropathy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient enjoys hiking.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports subjective fever and chills\nRespiratory: Reports cough and shortness of breath with ambulation.\nGastrointestinal: Denies nausea and vomiting.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain and right calf cramping.\nSkin: Reports right foot ulcer with yellow foul smelling drainage, and red streaking coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature is slightly elevated.\nVitals are otherwise good.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Edema and pain in calf. Bilateral palpable femoral and papiteal pulses are present. I do not recognize a palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse; however, they are present via Doppler.\nMSK: Examination of the right foot: The necrotic wound on his heel is present. It is approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. I do recognize the sloughing of the tissue, as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area, and erythema. An odor is present from the wound. I do not appreciate any bony exposure now. No pain to palpation in the effected area.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis or infection.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight non-healing diabetic foot ulcer.\nDiabetes.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that I do not see any evidence of osteomyelitis. I am concerned about the redness that is moving up his leg, as well as the swelling, and pain that he has in his calf. I have recommended that we obtain a venous ultrasound to check his blood supply for the wound. I have also recommended that we perform a debridement of the wound today. We may have to obtain a culture and look at different antibiotic therapy. I am recommending that he continue with antibiotics that his primary care physician prescribed.\n\nIn regard to his diabetes, I have advised him to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure that we do continue to keep his hemoglobin A1c below 7. We will need to closely monitor his blood sugar since we are going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and potentially some other medications depending on the culture results.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on his progress.",

good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press\n[patient] it's a little bit sore\n[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all\n[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel\n[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day\n[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so\n[doctor] do you have any questions about that\n[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just\n[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this\n[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing\n[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound\n[patient] that's fine\n[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound\n[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues\n[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable\n[patient] okay that'd be good\n[doctor] okay anything else\n[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave\n[doctor] well you know where to find me okay\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] take care bye",
