do you have a history of heavy periods ?\n[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .\n[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?\n[patient] about five to six years ago .\n[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?\n[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .\n[doctor] well that's good news .\n[patient] yeah , i agree .\n[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?\n[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .\n[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?\n[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .\n[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?\n[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .\n[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?\n[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .\n[doctor] okay . anything else ?\n[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .\n[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .\n[patient] sounds good . thank you .\n[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .\n[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?\n[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .\n[patient] lovely .\n[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?\n[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .\n[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .\n[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .\n[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .\n[patient] okay , that sounds great .\n[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .\n[patient] thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .\n[patient] you too .\n[doctor] all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .",

specifically feeling sick , fever , rashes , neck stiffness , numbness , weakness , passing out ?\n[patient] no . i have n't been sick or felt sick . ca n't recall a fever or any kind of rash . no- no neck issues , no numbness , no tingling . and i've never passed out in my life . but , um , for some reason recently i seem to be bumping into door frames .\n[doctor] okay . have you noticed any change in your vision or with your balance ?\n[patient] no i do n't think so . my eyes were checked in the fall .\n[doctor] okay . let's see , do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ?\n[patient] no i do n't have any medical problems and i do n't take any medicines . i tried tylenol a few times for the headaches but it did n't work , so i stopped .\n[doctor] i see . anyone in your family have any history of diseases ?\n[patient] i was adopted so i really have no idea .\n[doctor] okay . um , what kind of work do you do ?

did you wake up with it ?\n[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .\n[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?\n[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .\n[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?\n[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .\n[doctor] okay . i see .\n[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .\n[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?\n[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .\n[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?\n[patient] yes . with eating .\n[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?\n[patient] mm-hmm . i did .\n[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?\n[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .\n[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .\n[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .\n[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?\n[patient] they're normal .\n[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?\n[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .\n[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?\n[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .\n[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?\n[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .\n[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?\n[patient] i'd say it's about the same .\n[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .\n[patient] okay . good .\n[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .\n[patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .\n[doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?\n[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .\n[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk .\n[patient] no . that's it . thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks .",

            "src": "[doctor] hey diana it's good to see you in here so i see that you injured your wrist could you tell me a bit about what happened\n[patient] yeah i was walking up and down the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen\n[doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right\n[patient] it's my right one of course\n[doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before\n[patient] no i have not\n[doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain\n[patient] gosh it's like a nine\n[doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it\n[patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] really\n[doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen\n[patient] this happened yesterday morning\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just not it's really bad\n[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry\n[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally\n[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere\n[patient] no not really\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just really along my wrist\n[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling\n[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling\n[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well\n[patient] yeah it does\n[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like\n[patient] not without extreme pain\n[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up\n[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually\n[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] alright and then lateral as well\n[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason\n[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist\n[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight\n[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you\n[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all\n[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down\n[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better\n[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] pardon what\n[patient] a what\n[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace\n[patient] okay thank you\n[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay\n[patient] when do i have to have the surgery\n[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so what\n[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace\n[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks\n[patient] six weeks\n[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of\n[patient] oof\n[doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions\n[patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so\n[doctor] okay how long is the vacation\n[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks\n[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks\n[patient] no vacation in a month\n[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] no problem bye\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present",

            "src": "[doctor] hey philip good to see you today so take a look here at my notes i see you're coming in for some right knee pain and you have a past medical history of hypertension and we will take a look at that so can you tell me what happened to your knee\n[patient] yeah i was you know i was just doing some work on my property and i i accidentally slipped and fell down and i just still having some knee issues\n[doctor] okay well that that's not good do you\n[patient] no\n[doctor] what part of your knee would you say hurts\n[patient] i would just say you know the it it you know it basically when i when i'm flexing my knee when i'm moving it up and down and i put pressure on it\n[doctor] alright did you hear a pop or anything like that\n[patient] i did feel something pop yes\n[doctor] okay and did it was it swollen afterwards or is it looks a little bit swollen right now\n[patient] yeah little bit swollen yeah\n[doctor] okay so so far have you taken anything for the pain\n[patient] just taking some ibuprofen just for some swelling\n[doctor] okay that's it what would you say your pain score is a out of ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt\n[patient] i would say that when i'm stationary i do n't really feel a lot of pain but if i start doing some mobility i would say probably a four five\n[doctor] about a four okay and how long ago did you say this was is this happened this injury\n[patient] it's been a week now\n[doctor] a week okay alright alright so we will take a look i'll do a physical exam of your knee in a second but i do want to check up you do have a past medical history of hypertension i'm seeing here you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly\n[patient] yes i have\n[doctor] okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that\n[patient] i definitely need some help there i have not have not made some some changes\n[doctor] okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today\n[patient] no\n[doctor] are you any belly pain\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no shortness of breath just wan na make sure\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so i'm just gon na listen to your lungs here your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any wheezes or crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do still hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and you already had that and so we we knew about that already so lem me look at your knee here so when i press here on the inside of your knee does that hurt\n[patient] a little bit\n[doctor] little bit how about when i press on the outs the outside gon na press on the outside is that painful\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no alright so i'm gon na have you flex your knee is that painful\n[patient] yeah that's uncomfortable\n[doctor] that's uncomfortable and extend it so that's painful\n[patient] yeah yes\n[doctor] okay so on your knee exam i i see that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of your right knee you have some pain with flexion extension i also identify some edema around the knee and some effusion you have a little bit of fluid in there as well so prior to coming in we did do an x-ray of that right knee and luckily you did n't break anything so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have what we call a mcl strain so a medial collateral ligament strain so when you fell i think you twisted a little bit and so it irritated you strained that that ligament there so for that what we can do for you first i'm gon na prescribe you some ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams and you can take that twice a day and that's gon na help you with that swelling and that pain that you currently do have i'm also gon na put you in a a knee brace just to try and support those muscles to allow it to heal and then i want you to ice the knee you can do that for twenty minutes at a time for three to four times a day that should also help with the the swelling of your knee for your hypertension now i'm gon na keep you on that twenty of lisinopril okay because you are taking it and you you're doing pretty good with it i also want to get you a referral to nutrition just to try to help you with that diet you know because right now you are your diet is little bit out of control so we just need to rain you in a little bit and hopefully you know with their help we can eventually get you off that lisinopril alright so do you have any questions for me\n[patient] do i need to elevate my leg or stay off my leg or\n[doctor] yeah i would yeah you can elevate your leg stay off your stay off your leg you know if you have any kids have them work out in the yard instead of you just to to for a couple of weeks it's a good thing if you want to do that\n[patient] tell him this doctor's order\n[doctor] tell definitely tell him his doctor tell him i said it\n[patient] alright do you have any other questions no that's it i appreciate you seeing me\n[doctor] alright so my nurse will be in with the those orders and we will see you next time",

not the right knee it's the left knee\n[doctor] okay the left knee\n[patient] and it just happens occasionally less than once a day when i'm walking all of a sudden it is kind of like gives out and i think here i'm going to fall but i usually catch myself so lot of times i have to hold a grocery cart and that helps a lot so it comes and goes and it it passes just about as quickly as it comes i do n't know what it is whether i stepped wrong or i just do n't know\n[doctor] okay well so where does it hurt like in on the inside or the outside or\n[patient] internally and it it just the whole kneecap fades\n[doctor] okay well did you hear or feel a pop at any point\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] like that\n[doctor] have you ever had any type of injury to that knee i mean did you fall or bump it against something or\n[patient] no not that i can recall\n[doctor] okay and have is it painful have you taken anything for for pain\n[patient] no because it does n't last that long\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it just like i said it just it goes about as fast as i came in\n[doctor] so is it interfering with your just things you like to do and\n[patient] hmmm no not really\n[doctor] so i know you said that you like to do a lot of travel\n[patient] yeah i've got a trip planned here in the next month or so and we are going down to columbus georgia to a a lion's club function and probably be doing a lot of walking there and they got some line dances planned and i do n't think i will be able to participate in that because of the knee\n[doctor] is that where you would be kicking your leg out or something\n[patient] no it's do n't you know what line dancing is like dancing in theories of fairly fast moves but it's mostly sideways motion\n[doctor] and is and that you think that's when your knee might give out then or just not gon na take the chance\n[patient] not gon na take the chance\n[doctor] okay yeah that sounds like a good idea have you thought about even having a a cane just in case or do you think that's does that happen often enough\n[patient] wrap it i would n't be able to keep track of it so no no pain\n[doctor] okay okay well so since you're in how about your blood pressure how how is it doing and have you been taking your blood pressures at home like we talked about\n[patient] yes they are doing fine still about the same\n[doctor] so\n[patient] correct that whatever\n[doctor] so what has it been running\n[patient] i ca n't really remember it's been several days since i took it but i think it runs around one twenty over seventy somewhere along in there\n[doctor] okay alright and so what about your medication we have you on some medication for your blood pressure right\n[patient] yes i take take them regularly at eight thirty in the morning and eight thirty at night\n[doctor] and what is the medication and the dosage that you are taking\n[patient] i'm taking a farxiga and amlodipine\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and lisinopril and the hydrochlorothiazide so i i ca n't pronounce that one so but those are all small dosage pills\n[doctor] that but yeah go ahead\n[patient] no that was it i just take them regularly eight thirty in the morning eight thirty at night\n[doctor] yeah well that's good i i know you said you set an alarm on your phone to make sure that you get them taken at the right time so that's really good and how are your blood sugars doing how is your diet doing\n[patient] my blood sugar has been running a little higher at about one thirty\n[doctor] is that in the morning when you're fasting\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i have been told that sometimes the morning blood sugars are higher for some reason but i do n't know i i do n't really worry about it as long as it does n't get up too extremely high so\n[doctor] and are you taking your metformin\n[patient] yes yes that's along with the blood pressure medicine morning and night\n[doctor] okay alright so are you are you eating like late at night or anything like that\n[patient] no we usually eat by six\n[doctor] okay okay alright well hopefully we can get you to feeling better okay so i want to do a quick physical exam really check that knee out so your vital signs look good they they look alright your temperature is ninety eight . two your pulse is seventy two respirations are sixteen blood pressure is one twenty two over seventy so that looks fine i'm gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs so on your heart exam it's a nice regular rate and rhythm but i appreciate a slight two over six systolic ejection murmur at the left base here on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally okay now let's take a quick look at that knee so does it hurt when i press on it\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay can you bend your knee and straighten it out\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na do some maneuvers and i'm gon na just gon na call out my findings on this okay on your right knee exam no ecchymosis or edema no effusion no pain to palpation of the of the left medial knee is there any decreased range of motion do you feel you feel like you're you're able to fully move that as you should the same as the other knee\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay so no decreased range of motion negative varus and valgus test okay and so with your x-rays i reviewed the result of your left knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so lem me tell you a little bit about my plan so your left knee pain i think you just have some arthritis in that i want to prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams a day we might do some physical therapy for that just to strengthen the muscles around that area and prevent any further problems with that okay and so for your second problem the hypertension so i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams a day and order an echocardiogram just to evaluate that heart murmur alright and\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] for the diabetes mellitus i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin and i'm also gon na order a lipid panel okay do you have any questions\n[patient] no i do n't think so when will all this take place\n[doctor] we will get you scheduled for the echocardiogram i will have my nurse come in and we will get that set up okay",

cough\n[patient] more dry\n[doctor] a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat\n[patient] this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] to see if it can it you know the dry coughing if it's part of that or what i can do\n[doctor] okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there\n[patient] no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would\n[doctor] okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems\n[patient] the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong\n[doctor] okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone\n[patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me\n[doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue\n[patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming\n[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far\n[patient] that sounds great thank you\n[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss\n[patient] great\n[doctor] okay any questions for me\n[patient] i do n't believe so at this time\n[doctor] okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit\n[patient] great thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome and so now just",

abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today\n[patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding\n[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me\n[patient] yeah that's a mouthful\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here\n[doctor] i'll do this\n[patient] i i think i would break that\n[doctor] yeah i just saw that\n[patient] if you can do that\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up\n[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me\n[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections\n[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual\n[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections\n[doctor] diarrhea no\n[patient] frequently\n[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of\n[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies\n[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy\n[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions\n[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes\n[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street\n[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes\n[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that\n[doctor] i know i know\n[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away\n[doctor] right\n[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products\n[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally\n[patient] okay where did you go\n[doctor] i was in zambia\n[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful\n[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time\n[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial\n[doctor] no\n[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you\n[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried\n[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea\n[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and\n[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency\n[doctor] why is that\n[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency\n[doctor] okay okay thank you\n[patient] you're welcome\n[doctor] okay",

            "src": "[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that\n[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it\n[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics\n[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left\n[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now\n[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point\n[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that\n[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc\n[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park\n[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now\n[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there\n[patient] i

meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure\n[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture\n[doctor] correct\n[patient] if i heard\n[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy\n[patient] okay sounds good\n[doctor] alright",

seems to be doing okay the lisinopril works well\n[doctor] good i was just gon na ask you if you were taking your lisinopril so that's good okay and any side effects from the lisinopril since we started it i think we started it about a year ago two years ago\n[patient] no no no side effects that i'm aware of\n[doctor] no side effects okay and then in terms of your diabetes are you watching your sugar intake\n[patient] yeah i usually watch it the form of high what i'm eating but\n[doctor] i am a big pie fan as well i know what's your favorite type of pie\n[patient] well you know it's favorite boy i just like pie you know apples cherry chocolate you know bicon\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i try to try to avoid the bicon because i think it's just all sugar but i do like it\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] less\n[doctor] i like it too alright are you taking the metformin twice a day\n[patient] not everyday but most of the time\n[doctor] okay alright and are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly\n[patient] i try to\n[doctor] okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or\n[patient] yeah it's definitely running below that\n[doctor] okay your blood sugars are running below\n[patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty\n[doctor] good\n[patient] pretty regular\n[doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press\n[patient] it's a little bit sore\n[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all\n[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel\n[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day\n[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so\n[doctor] do you have any questions about that\n[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just\n[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this\n[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing\n[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound\n[patient] that's fine\n[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound\n[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues\n[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable\n[patient] okay that'd be good\n[doctor] okay anything else\n[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave\n[doctor] well you know where to find me okay\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] take care bye",
