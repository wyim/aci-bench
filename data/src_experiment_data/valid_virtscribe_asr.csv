[patient] no they said they had seen me in 10 years . [doctor] good news i agree with a pacemaker defibrillator or have sleep apnea or use oxygen at night now drink alcohol yeah but only once or twice a year okay are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 i restarted taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year what are you taking i'm taking 25 mg tablets twice daily okay and that the ferrous sulfate yet that i take 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening okay anything else er i take vitamin b12 just the over-the-counter stuff . i will go ahead and take a look and see what is going on sounds good thank you of course you will hear me talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright so use my general physical exam template . i will start with listening to your heart and lungs . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright next , i would like you to lay back , so i can examine your abdomen . [patient] okay . [doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay , you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . i must have been sent often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms we suspect internal bleeding want me to have another upper endoscopy actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy but yes likely that's the reason why . [patient] lovely . [doctor] yeah unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle so if those tests back if those tests come back fine then we will have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your system . [patient] okay . [doctor] we may not need to but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist that will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron or maybe something to help your body store the iron better . [patient] alright . [doctor] so lets go ahead and get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled okay have you ever had any issues with sedation in the past no i was just sleepy afterwards okay well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time if we do these tests and they are normal like i said then we will consider that capsule endoscopy sounds like a plan alright , so after that , you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i may need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better , do this for about 8 to 12 weeks and then we can reassess your blood work . [patient] okay . that sounds great . [doctor] alright , well i think we have our plan on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy . we will send a referral to dr. flores who is the hematologist to schedule that appointment . here are your instructions for the the bowel prep , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms , we'll be happy to help you .

virtscribe,VS015,"[doctor] next is betty hill date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she is a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . i reviewed our records from the er including the normal cardiac work-up and we're about to go and see her now . good morning , you miss hill ? [patient] good morning , yes , that's me . [doctor] hey , i'm dr. sanders , it's nice to meet you . [patient] nice to meet you too . [doctor] so tell me about what brings you in today ? 3 months ago but this was your first available appointment when i called to make the appointment i was having chest pain but stopped after 4 days and i have n't had any since then okay , when did these 4 days of chest pain occur ? [patient] early october . [doctor] of 2020 , correct ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay , can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain , did you wake up with it ? for 4 days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieve.bunch of testing and did n't find anything okay , can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ? [patient] well it was here in the center of my chest right behind my breast bone it felt like i was having a heart attack , the pain was really sharp . [doctor] did they prescribe any medications in the er ? okay i see . [patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system so that's why they referred me here . [doctor] interesting . do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at the time ? [patient] maybe had heartburn so i'm not sure what that feels like . [doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ? [patient] yes with eating . [doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ? [patient] mm-hmm i did . [doctor] okay and that's also resolved since the initial episode 3 months ago ? yes thankfully the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about 3 days after i went to the er there is something wrong okay so how has your weight been ? [patient] i've been trying to lose weight . [doctor] that's good . any , any issues with abdominal pain ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay , good and how about your bowel movements , are they okay ? [patient] they're normal . [doctor] alright , are you aware of any family history of gi problems ? [patient] i do n't think so . [doctor] have you had any surgeries on your abdomen or gallbladder or appendix ? [patient] yes . they took my gallbladder out several years ago . [doctor] okay . if you would , lay down here on the table for me and let's take a look at you . [patient] okay . [doctor] so when i push you on your lower belly , do you have any pain or does it feel tender ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay . how about upper abdomen ? [patient] yes it it hurts a little . [doctor] okay and even when i pressed the lightly like this ? [patient] yes little uncomfortable . [doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right or is it about the same ? [patient] i would say it's about the same . [doctor] okay . well , we will say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er , [patient] other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus , but typically with these but typically these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had , [doctor] it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days . [patient] well since you mentioned anxiety i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time that happened . [doctor] okay that's good to know . the stress from this could , could be very well have contributed to your condition . [patient] okay . [doctor] so we could do an egd or an upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis , but since your symptoms occur , 3 months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes . it's likely that if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point , by this point and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor . [patient] for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option , but what do you think ? i would like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms . [doctor] that sounds good . so you can call my office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we will get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow with me as follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright . you do n't have any questions for me . i'll walk you out to the checkout desk . [patient] no , that's it . thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . right this way . [patient] alright in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly and let's list for possible etiologies such as gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety , [doctor] suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies in the plan include our discussion of the egd versus monitoring monitoring for symptoms patient elected to self monitor for symptoms and will call with any recurrence or change thanks .","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Esophagitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of suspected esophagitis. The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.

The patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.

The patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Uterine fibroids.
Anemia.

Surgical
Cholecystectomy.

FAMILY HISTORY

None reported.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Cardiovascular:  Positive for chest pain.
• Gastrointestinal:  Positive for difficulty swallowing.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
Mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.

RESULTS

The patient’s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient’s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.

Non-cardiac chest pain.

Suspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.

PLAN

• We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD. The patient is agreeable to this plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Self-monitor for symptom recurrence and notify my office if this occurs.
• Follow up as needed."

Renal screening tests.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Katherine Lopez is a 22-month-old female, born at 34 weeks +3 days gestation, diagnosed with the rare Smith-Magenis syndrome and associated global developmental delays. She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow’s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where “the kidneys fuse into one” and issues with their legs.

The patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates “a lot”. The patient drinks Ripple Pea Protein milk instead of cow’s milk, water and water mixed with a small amount of juice. Her twin sister is approximately the same size, and their weight is essentially the same, she is healthy, and the mom denies any known health concerns or diagnoses. The mom states that Katherine is shorter and seems chubbier related to her syndrome. She also has a 9-year-old brother who is diagnosed with autism.

virtscribe,VS024,"[doctor] patient bruce ward , date of birth 5/21/1969 . please use my neuro consult template . this is a 52-year-old male with newly diagnosed pituitary lesion . [patient] the patient is seen in consultation at the request of dr. henry howard for possible surgical mr. ward presented to his primary care provider , dr . howard on 3/1/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months . he denied any trouble with headaches in the past . his past medical history is unremarkable . work-up for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3/3/2021 including cbc , u and e's , coagulation , and crp all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh . all other results were normal . i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri of the brain with contrast from 3/4/2021 . [doctor] the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are are noted . hello mr. ward , nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores . [patient] hi doc , nice to meet you . [doctor] i was just reviewing your records from doctor howard and he has referred you because the work-up for headaches revealed a mass in your pituitary gland . [patient] i did review your mri images and . there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ? [doctor] yeah , sure , so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them , but they have been going on for months now and i'm really struggling . where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ? [patient] located behind my eyes , it's like a dull nagging ache . [doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ? [patient] well this started about 3 months ago and they've been getting worse over time , at first it was like 3 out of 10 in severity and it just gradually worsened , now it's about 6 out of 10 in severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . [doctor] they last a few hours at a time and nothing makes them better or worse . [patient] okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates or if you have any other symptoms specifically feeling sick , fever , rashes , neck stiffness , numbness , weakness , passing out ? no . i have n't been sick or felt sick . ca n't recall a fever or any kind of rash . no , no neck issues , no numbness , no tingling and i've never passed out in my life . but for some reason recently i seemed to be bumping the door frames . [doctor] okay , have you noticed any change in your vision or with your balance ? [patient] no , i do n't think so . my eyes were checked in the fall . [doctor] okay , let's see . do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ? [patient] no , i do n't have any medical problems and i do n't take any medicines . i tried tylenol a few times for the headaches , but it did n't work , so i stopped . [doctor] let's see . anyone in your family have any history of diseases ? [patient] i was adopted , so i really have no idea . [doctor] okay . what kind of work do you do and are you married ? [patient] i work as a computer programmer and i've been married for 25 years . we just bought a small house . [doctor] well that's nice . do you drink any alcohol , smoke , or use recreational drugs ? nope , i do n't do any of those and never have . [patient] okay . well , let me take a good look at you . now you hear me calling out some details as i perform the examination . these will be noted for me in your record and i will be happy to answer any questions you have once we are done . [doctor] sounds good document . [patient] alright the patient is alert , oriented to time , place , and person . affect is appropriate and speech is fluent . [doctor] cranial nerve examination is grossly intact . no focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities . visual acuity and eye movements are normal . pupils are equal and reactive . visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia . [patient] and color vision is normal . alright , mr. ward , i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . here you can see it's a well defined mass and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the side . that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia and explains why you have been bumping into door frames . yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test and they closed my eye with both eyes really could n't tell . now because you're having this vision loss from the mask compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery . okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ? [doctor] well , there is no guarantee , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and we will do what's called visual field test . [patient] this will knock out your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving . [doctor] alright . and let's discuss the surgery a little more . we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go to the sphenoid sinus . [patient] there are some risks i have to inform you of . risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death , risks of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues , such as spinal fluid , leak or infection , which may require a long prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking or even death . [doctor] well i guess we have to do it regardless . [patient] okay so i will have you see our surgery scheduler , deborah on the way out to get you set up . we will get this scheduled fairly quickly , so i do n't want you to be alarmed . she will also get you set up today or tomorrow to have the visual field test and you may not be able to see the eye doctor until after surgery but we have the presurgery , visual field test for comparison after surgery . [doctor] okay . i look forward to these headaches going away . i never thought it could be something like this going on . [patient] yeah . come this way , but that things lined up , please call if you think of any questions . [doctor] thanks doctor . [patient] diagnosis will be pituitary adenoma . mr . ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has benign appearing pituitary adenoma incidentally discovered during work-up for worsening headaches . he is symptomatic with .

The patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.

Mr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.

The patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
Patient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent. Cranial nerve examination grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities.

Eyes
Visual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.

RESULTS

Labs reviewed, 03/03/2021: CBC, U&Es, coagulation, and CRP are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal.

Independent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

• Pituitary adenoma
• Bitemporal hemianopia

Mr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.

PLAN

Pituitary adenoma.
We discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma.

Bitemporal hemianopia.
We will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing.
• Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.
