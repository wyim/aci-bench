[patient] okay . [doctor] you're going to hear me describe things in detail or repeat things as i go to reference later for my notes . [patient] okay . [doctor] okay then i'm going to be using my status post template ms. sanchez please lie down on the table here and will get started on right can you turn your head to the left head and neck no jvd detected . you can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please . okay , that's good and lungs have reduced breath , but auscultation and percussion are clear . okay , breathe normally . i'm just going to listen to your heart . rhythm is irregularly irregular yet it does sound kind of weird right it is when your heart does n't beat with the correct rhythm and what ever rhythm it does n't have a pattern to it so it is part of the atrial fibrillation while that sound like a mass yet it is not ideal but many people have a. fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes ac not good to know okay so s1 slightly accentuated no s3 i'm going to touch your belly and does any of that hurt ? [patient] nope . [doctor] how about there and your feet no not really okay great and trace peripheral edema on extremities alright ms. sanchez you can sit up now so it looks like your health heart heart valves are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely l good yes we are we looked at your ecg taken earlier today and we are seeing the a. fib but it is being well controlled with the medicine and you're taking coumadin 4 mg lasix at 4 mg a day and the atenolol you're taking that every day as well right yes the 50 mg every day great it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery great so lets continue on your current meds i'm glad that you are figuring out what your body can handle definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help all your best and that is about it to have any questions for me i do when do i need to come back and get checked out well i do n't think you need to come back soon everything from a cardio perspective is fine so i think lets do a follow-up in about 6 to 9 months thank you it was good to see you again dr. hughes you as well ms. sanchez to take care you to .",

[patient] i'm good , thank you . [doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ? [patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have or really even what it is . [doctor] okay so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea or is that completely new as far as you know ? [patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur , so of course i'm worried as well . [doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ? [patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having . [doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one , so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to . [patient] no , i definitely do n't . [doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or feel shortness of breath ? [patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . my problem is i have severe pains in my legs and so she had me go in for a chest x-ray and that was just last week . [doctor] okay . [patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs . [doctor] okay , got it for the legs and do you feel short of breath at all ? [patient] if i walk too fast or too long or if i try to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way . [doctor] okay and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ? [patient] well i do have a walker now , so i do n't know , maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or walk around the culvasec . [doctor] got it , alright . [patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all maybe more if i try to overdo it . [doctor] okay . [patient] then i i get short of breath if i do overdo it though . [doctor] okay , got it and so how different would you say that these symptoms are now compared to like 6 months ago or a year ago ? [patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about 6 months ago . before that , i did n't notice anything at all . [doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ? [patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now . [doctor] okay and how about do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ? [patient] yeah , so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad . [doctor] okay . [patient] yeah , and i do n't take it everyday , only when i do feel dizzy . [doctor] okay , and so how about any passing out at all ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heart beats , do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ? [patient] i do n't notice it at all . [doctor] okay , great and how about any swelling in the legs at all ? [patient] yeah , my ankles swell . [doctor] okay , and how long has this been going on ? [patient] i would say for probably 6 months , but it goes up and down and sometimes it's worse than other times . [doctor] okay and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ? [patient] i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds . [doctor] mm-hmm okay . [patient] but that's been going down gradually for about a year . [doctor] okay and then how about any fevers , chills , or anything else that's going on that you can think of ? [patient] no . [doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in mostly because of the murmur , is that right and sort of just kinda seeing what things look like ? [patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication . [doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ? [patient] i'm not really sure . [doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of surgeries here uh ? [patient] yeah , you name it . [doctor] alright , well , i will make you repeat them since i do you have a good record ? but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? alright got them and then are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay , good and looking at your family history , looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack , is that correct ? [patient] it was actually my son , not my brother . [doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment . [patient] but my brother did have a stroke , but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes and my older sister did have a heart problem as well . [doctor] okay , i see . [patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family . [doctor] okay . alright , well , it looks like also that you've never smoked , that's excellent and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ? [patient] correct . [doctor] alright , well let's do a quick exam . [patient] alright , sounds good . [doctor] alright , well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . alright , please just breathe normally . great and now take a few deep breaths for me alright . do you feel okay , are you feeling any dizziness or anything ? [patient] no , i feel fine . [doctor] okay , great . alright , well that is it for the exam . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , so what i'm thinking is let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i can order that for today . do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long . [patient] yes , that's fine . i have time . [doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today to oversess your overall cardiac structure and function as well as the valvular disease . [patient] okay . [doctor] and some possible outcomes and what we might suggest to fix it . i'll , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called aortic stenosis and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open quite fully and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body and that's called the aorta into the rest of your body . [patient] okay . [doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement or we wrote just called it tavr and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve . [patient] well i would have to think about that . i , i'm not too sure i want to do that given my age at all . [doctor] yeah , sure , no problem and we do n't have to make any decisions today just you know wanted to go over a couple of these things . but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement or it's called an sa vr but really because of your age and medical history unfortunately that would n't be a good option for you . [patient] i see . okay , well i guess we'll see what you see from , from the test . [doctor] yeah , agree . okay . and so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we are not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril so just continue taking those as you are currently . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] and then it also looks like you are taking about 20 mg of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will defer to your pcp , however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs and given your age and no history of coronary artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin . [patient] really ? [doctor] yeah possibly he would have to evaluate you but it is certainly something to discuss with him so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin . [patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you . [doctor] you're welcome and then lastly your hypothyroidism , i see you're taking the levothyroxine and again no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have been . [patient] okay , i will . [doctor] alright . so we will see you back here in about 3 to 4 weeks to discuss the results and your next steps and we'll take care of your echocardiogram today . any questions ? [patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . i think i will sweat . [doctor] okay , awesome . alright . well , have a good rest of your day and we will see you soon . for physical exam , constitutional , elderly , otherwise no acute distress . cardiovascular normal . s1 and s2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm . there is a 4 out of 6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids . neurologic , gait is normal for age . for assessment and plan , probably one cardiac murmur , diana has a 4-6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the keratids . this is most likely representative of aortic stenosis . her symptoms could be due to severe aortic aortic stenosis , however , her s2 is relatively preserved , which would be more consistent with consistent with moderate . some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction , so it is possible she , she did have an echocardiogram at some point in the past . she does not appear significantly volume overloaded today . her next problem is pvcs . her referral mentioned tachycardia . her ekg today shows sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs . as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern . she does not have any significant palpitations and we will check an echocardiogram to assess over overall cardiac structure and function . depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis , we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or further possibly a heart monitor to assess overall burden of the pvcs . at this point , she is asymptomatic , so we will start with the echocardiogram only . her next problem , hyperlipidemia is managed by her pcp due to bilateral leg pain over the last month , consider tavr evaluation following echocardiogram . could be indicated and next problem , lightheadedness , dizziness . she is on meclizine for this . it is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness is related to the aorta stenosis and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above . pvcs on her ekg could be contributing but she does not feel palpitations . we will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above . follow up 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps . end of dictation .",
            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHeart murmur.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDiana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of a heart murmur.\n\nMs. Scott has been recently diagnosed with a \u201cnew, worrisome\u201d heart murmur. She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling \u201coverly tired\u201d but attributes this to her polypharmacy.\n\nThe patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHyperlipidemia.\nHypertension.\nHypothyroid.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nRequires a walker to ambulate.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nSon had a myocardial infarction.\nBrother had a stroke and has diabetes.\nOlder sister has an unknown heart problem.\nFamily is positive for heart disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nLevothyroxine.\nLisinopril.\nSimvastatin 20 mg.\nMeclizine.\nAmlodipine.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nElderly, no acute distress.\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal S1, S2 preserved, irregular rhythm and normal rate. 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLower extremity edema\n\nNeurologic\nGait normal for age.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEKG\nImpression: Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Cardiac murmur.\n\u2022 PVCs.\n\u2022 Hypertension.\n\u2022 Hyperlipidemia.\n\u2022 Hypothyroid.\n\u2022 Lightheadedness/dizziness.\n\nPLAN\n\nCardiac murmur\nDiana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.\n\nPVCs\nHer referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.\n\nHypertension\nShe is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nThis is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.\n\nHypothyroidism\nShe takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.\n\nLightheadedness/dizziness\nShe is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.\n",

She is accompanied by her mother today.\n\nKayla states her acne started approximately 2 years ago and it is present almost every day. The patient\u2019s mother notes that the most significant acne flares started in the fall when she was playing school sports. It does not tend to flare with her periods. Kayla reports that today is a good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain.\n\nThe patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nLives with parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and rabbits in the home. She is in the 7th grade and active in basketball, volleyball, and tap dancing.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo significant family medical history.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nFull exam is performed today except for under the underwear and under the bra. There are multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities.

Full skin examination revealed mild to moderate comedonal acne with a small inflammatory component and multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\n\nPLAN\n\nComedonal acne.\nWe discussed the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment options. I recommend starting with topical therapy first. The patient was instructed to wash face every morning with a mild cleanser, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 of higher. In the evening, wash face with same mild cleanser and allow to dry. Apply a thin layer of topical retinoid, Retin-A 0.1% gel, to acne prone areas. Start off using a few nights a week, slowly work up to using every night. If it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try Differin gel over the counter. Your topical retinoid will cause sun sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.\n\nMultiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\nReassurance given moles are normal in appearance and have no concerning characteristics. Will continue to monitor for progression or changes in 6 months.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow recommended cleaning regimen.\nStart Retin-A 0.1% topical gel, apply to acne prone areas, titrate as instructed.\nFollow up in 6 months.\n",

[patient] sure , so i've been having constant pain in my left shoulder and left elbow for a while about 5 months or so , hurts all the time , pretty bad at times . [doctor] hmmm that does not sound like fun . it sounds like you injured it going up the stairs ? [patient] yes , that's correct . it was icy and i have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house . i stepped and my feet just went out , fell on my left side . seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt , it's been hurting since . [doctor] yeah , that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms . anything seemed to make the pain worse ?

[doctor] i do not blame you mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ? [patient] not too much . i have iced a bit , but i have not taken anything for the pain . stopping the exercise and some ice has helped a bit , but it still hurts enough for me to come to see you .

[doctor] we are okay , thank you . [patient_guest] that's good to hear . so how many days has randy been feeling sick ? [doctor] well i would say it started around suppertime last night . [patient_guest] last night , okay and what's been going on ? [doctor] well , he started to get a runny nose . [patient_guest] okay , does he stuffy too ? [doctor] yeah , yeah . [patient_guest] and have you noticed , is his mucus clear right now ? [doctor] it is , it is right now , yes . [patient_guest] pain , does he also have a cough ? [doctor] yes , but it's not barky . [patient_guest] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ? [doctor] well , i know he has been pulling on his ears , yeah . [patient_guest] okay . [doctor] you know he also , he has also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too . [patient_guest] okay and any fever you've noticed ? [doctor] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 . [patient_guest] okay , so little bit of a low grade fever there definitely and how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ? [doctor] yes , he did , yeah . [patient_guest] and how about this morning , did he eat his breakfast ? [doctor] this morning he ate about 7 ounces from the bottle . [patient_guest] okay . [doctor] and then he got another bottle and he barely ate that . i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either . [patient_guest] okay . [doctor] so he varies i guess . [patient_guest] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps or does he have pretty good energy ? [doctor] it seems like he is irritable . [patient_guest] irritable because he is n't feeling good . [doctor] yeah he is energetic but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep like he is fighting it really hard . [patient_guest] okay just for the chart , is there anyone anybody else exposed to them who has been sick ? [doctor] yes , his older sister has been sick . [patient_guest] thank you . [doctor] we also had a date with my nephew who i learned later had a sinus infection . [patient_guest] and what medications have you tried for him , anything at all ? [doctor] i've been doing the saline mist in his nose . [patient_guest] good , that's a , a good choice . [doctor] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him . [patient_guest] and we have the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating . [doctor] i see and any other medications ? [patient_guest] we did put some baby vicks on his feet last night to try and help him breathe and i also used the humidifier . okay , that's good . [doctor] okay , okay . [patient_guest] so there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here , it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse , what are you using on it ? [doctor] i've been using the cradle cap brush and then i use regular aveeno shampoo . [patient_guest] is it a dandruff shampoo ? [doctor] no , i do n't think so . [patient_guest] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we will talk about the next steps . [doctor] okay , sounds good . [patient_guest] can you take a big breath , randy , [doctor] where is mama ? [patient_guest] do n't forget to breathe , little one , [doctor] okay , let's try the front too . yeah , it's okay buddy . [patient_guest] excellent , he is doing excellent . next let's let's check out those ears . [doctor] okay . let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over . diane you're doing so good . alright , ears look okay . we are going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down . hey you're , hey , you're okay , you're okay . [patient_guest] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like . [doctor] alright , thank you . [patient_guest] alright so he is just kind of getting started with this and i think we are seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away but i do n't think he needs any antibiotics at least not at this point in time . keep up with the fluids , rest and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant , a little more severe . so if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine , you know i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] actually i will , i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [doctor] okay , okay . [patient_guest] but if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it , it only works for the barky cough . [doctor] hmmm got it . [patient_guest] okay and we will do the same thing with him as long as nothing gets worse and we will see him back in 1 week so it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him . it can help out a little bit with the regular cough . [doctor] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ? yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year . instead , you can give them a gave which is a different type of nectar . [patient_guest] now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him it would not be very good because the stomach acid is not good enough to break down the botulism spores , so it would cause him harm . you should look at the package of say honey nut cheerios it says right on there to not give it to a baby . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] now whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure but it has real honey in it , so no honey for him , but a gave a is definitely fine . okay . [doctor] so zarbee's for the stuffy nose . [patient_guest] yes , zarbee's . [doctor] and then you said which medicine to give him just in case ? [patient_guest] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister and just hang on to it just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , but since if it's gon na be the weekend and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow , i , i would rather you have just what you need on hand . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] right and does that make sense ? [doctor] yeah , yeah , that makes sense . [patient_guest] okay , great , and that way you do n't have to share with his sister . [doctor] right , okay . [patient_guest] and since he is about half her size , we will do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon . [doctor] okay . will this information all be in the papers ? [patient_guest] yes and so if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for 5 days . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is as needed or anything like that . [doctor] hmmm understood . thank you . [patient_guest] you're welcome . [doctor] and the cradle cap . [patient_guest] what i would do is use something like either head and shoulders or selsun blue or nizoral a.d. and i do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . krano cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff , so those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing because they they are all dead scales and you still have to brush them off , so continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil or something that will help get the scales out and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not everyday but maybe twice a week , so 2 days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then often within 6 weeks or so , you will notice that the the cradle cap is just not coming back anymore , but you have to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes , so just make sure when you're rinsing his hair , you avoid his eyes . [doctor] okay okay . [patient_guest] alright and if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know . [doctor] okay sounds good . [patient_guest] good and since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out . [doctor] okay and both appointments in a week . [patient_guest] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better . [doctor] alright , great . thank you so much . [patient_guest] you are welcome and have a good rest of your day .",

[doctor] well , i performed a lot of breast reduction surgeries pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure . [patient] okay , that's reassuring . yeah , so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having and then i'll do a quick exam . okay . that sounds good . and then we will talk more about the surgery and what it entails and at this point who is your insurance provider ? actually my husband just accepted a new job and i will be on his plan which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing . [doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , [patient] document your symptoms , symptoms , we will take some pictures , then they get sent to the insurance company and what they will do is decide whether it's approved or medically necessary or not but we want to make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you will be on the new plan ? mostly july . okay , so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time . okay . [doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ? [patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . [doctor] pain here and here not painful.when i'm walking at my desk all day . [patient] okay and in your neck and your upper back and how long has this been going on would you say 5 years , 10 years or even since puberty ? i would say since i was in high school . okay and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders i saw that you're wearing about a g cup . [doctor] patient regular wellbe therapy more comfortable and that is extensive than . [patient] yeah , i have heard that as well and have you had any children , are you planning to have any children in the future ? no , i do not have any kids now but we might plan to in the future . okay and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the , in the hands or any nipple pain ? sometimes , yes . okay and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts and , and it could be from sweating ? no , but they are always sweaty . okay and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ? there are certain things i do when i have to hold them like working out and any jumping or running and it hurts . and it hurts , okay and , and you saw a chiropractor , but what about physical therapy for your back pain or do you take any pain medicine for it ? no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol . that's okay . so let's see , i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms and how old was your mother when she had it ? mom was 40 and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still , i mean i'm 25 , so i'm still a little bit young . [doctor] okay , and otherwise it seems like you're really healthy . [patient] yes for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds . congratulations , that's great and then you're welcome and so do you use any tobacco , drugs or alcohol and then you said that you were going to school , what are you going to school for ? i drink a little wine on occasion and for school , i'm currently setting psychology . [doctor] okay , that's great . alright , so what we will do is we will go ahead and take a look . i'm going to take a couple of measurements and we will kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . so go ahead and stand up for me julia . [patient] okay , so looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other , yeah . okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . okay . [doctor] so i think you are a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [patient] okay , that's fine . and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . wow . [doctor] so typically when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath and it kinda looks like an anchor below . [patient] then straight down and underneath and through that incision , we're able to to lift the breast and we'll take off any extra fat and brush breast tissue , so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup , so i do tell every patient , we can make you a small as your blood supply allows and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of it's blood supply during the surgery . okay . well , thank you for explaining that . you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you . okay . [doctor] and typically the surgery takes about 3 hours you will have drains one in each side and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast and that stays in for about a week and then we will remove them in the clinic . [patient] and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars and we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line . okay . well i'm not too worried about the card . okay and i do like to keep patients overnight , it's just going to be for one night in the hospital , [doctor] and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day , [patient] but you know that some people get nauseated and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility . okay . yeah , that sounds good . okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breast feed after a breast reduction and the reason is the breast is made up of fat and it's also made up of a gland and the gland is what produces the milk , okay . and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands , so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breast-feed in the future and then also the breast will change over time if you gain weight , they will get larger , things like that . yeah , okay . and if you have children they will change as well . they will enlarge especially if you can breast feed , but they will go back down will appear a little bit deflated . yeah i do n't know if i'm interested in breast feeding . okay the hormones of pregnancy though will change the breast , so that's just something to be aware of and i tell all younger patients that . okay , yeah , absolutely . and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you will have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple , generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised and then it just takes some time for that to go away . yeah , okay . but other than that you know most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because of the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions julia about the process or anything like that ? no , not really . [doctor] okay and , and i do think you are a good candidate for it and i think you will benefit from it as well . [patient] good . i look forward to the release . i think you just have to do it when you are ready when you know that you feel like it's a good time because it is a commitment and you will have some activity restrictions for about 6 weeks after surgery and no heavy lifting and i do say no driving for 2 to 3 weeks and the drain stay in like i said for about a week . okay well i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over . okay . well i think from this point if you want to , we can take photos today while you're here . i have all the documentation now and the note about your symptoms and that's what the insurance company is going to look for , so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted and then when they approve it , what the office will do is they'll work with you on a surgery date and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions . [doctor] and go over the instructions in more detail and things like that .

The patient has attempted non-surgical treatments with minimal relief and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Her minimum required resection based on a BSA of 2.65 with the Schnur scale is 1792 g, which should be attainable. Given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above, there is potential for using a free nipple graft.\n\nPLAN\n\nAn extensive discussion of breast reduction surgery was performed with the patient with consideration of the patient's age, co-morbidities, previous surgical history, body habitus, BMI, and smoking history. Surgical time, immediate recovery course, and longer term recovery course were discussed. Relief of the patient's current symptoms related to macromastia was not guaranteed though is expected to improve. Specific breast size was discussed, also not guaranteed. I explained the expected outcomes of using a free nipple graft such as an insensate nipple and an inability to breast feed. The patient understands that the decision for a free nipple graft will be made intraoperatively based on assessment of nipple perfusion.\n\nRisks and benefits of were discussed with the patient The patient understands the above risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery and wishes to proceed with bilateral reduction mammaplasty.\n\nThe patient will be switching to a different insurance policy in 07/2021. Once we get the new insurance information from the patient, we will submit it to her insurance company. If approved, she will return for preoperative counseling and consent.\n\nReturn to clinic prior to scheduled surgery date for preoperative counseling and consent.",

[patient] okay , how many times did you do that ? [doctor] it was n't often maybe once a week . [patient] okay so it sounds like we are still on track for discontinuing the prednisone , we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ? [doctor] yeah , definitely because i went to get my covid shots but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy , so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot . [patient] okay and what happened ? [doctor] i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later . [patient] i'm sorry to hear that and , and what did you do about the second dose ? [doctor] well i called into the hotline because i was in so much pain with the first one and they said no , just go ahead and take it , so i did . [patient] okay , that's good then . we do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high risk medication . do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time ? [doctor] no , they did n't give me one . [patient] okay . so we can do that for you too . so what questions do you have for me , judy ? [doctor] well i just wanted to know why i was getting all these bruises here so like when i bump myself , i do n't know where they are coming from . [patient] okay , that's probably from the prednisone , it can increase bruising . [doctor] okay , i did n't know that . i do n't even feel it when it happens , they just show up . [patient] yeah , unfortunately that can happen but we are working on discontinuing that , so let's see if the bruises do go away . [doctor] okay , that sounds good , thanks . [patient] okay judy , please sit up here and i'll take a look , shoes and socks off please . [doctor] alright . [patient] alright , let me see here , okay , so where is it hurting , in your joints right here ? [doctor] yeah , a little also in my feet joints as well . [patient] okay and how about when you bend the knee like this ? [doctor] well , it hurt before we increased the methotrexate , but it's doing pretty good now . okay , good . can you flex your toes please ? [patient] good range of motion also ridges and nails that's from the psoriasis . [doctor] yeah , they've been like that for a long time now . [patient] okay . alright miss gomez it looks like we are moving along with your treatment nicely . we will stop your prednisone and continue with the methotrexate . make sure you stop by the front desk and make an appointment for the blood work and i'll see you in 3 months . [doctor] alright , it sounds good . thank you so much . it was great to see you . [patient] it was great seeing you too . thank you .",

[patient] yes ma'am . [doctor] well , it looks like you have 1 stone in the left kidney , but it's not obstructing anything . [patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment and then for the past 6 weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine , the color of like cherry cholestee , and last week i was constantly having to pee , and it hurt something terrible . [doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of 0-10 , zero being no pain and 10 being worst as you can imagine . [patient] at the time i'd say an eight . [doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ? [patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better . [doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 mg a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ? [patient] that's right . [doctor] alright , well let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have 1 stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time . [patient] i would like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones . [doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease , and certain medical conditions . [patient] yeah i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything . [doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day . [patient] so if i weigh 250 pounds , i should drink . [doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew . [patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ? [doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium , oxalate , and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed foods because they are high in sodium . ideally you should consume less than 1000 mg of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork . [patient] what's oxalate ? [doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rubar , and soy products . [patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again . [doctor] great and here is a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid . [patient] okay , good . i like to have things in writing to help you remember . [doctor] perfect . well , if you have any more questions , if you do n't have any more questions , you're all set , i wo n't need to see you back until next year as long as you do n't have any more issues like bleeding or pain . if you do have any issues , you can always call the office sooner and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine , you should go to the emergency room . [patient] alright , well , let's hope we do n't have to do either of those and i see you next year . [doctor] yes , so let's hope . come right this way and i'll walk you to check out . update pe abdomen , no flank pain and to gu . normal vaginal exam . primary diagnosis is hematuria . secondary diagnosis is chronic urolithiasis . thank you . this is complete . mrs. wood encounter .",
