do you have a history of heavy periods ?\n[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .\n[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?\n[patient] about five to six years ago .\n[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ?

The patient is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention.\n\nThe patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.\n\nMr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.\n\nThe patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nNewly diagnosed pituitary lesion.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo known family history; adopted.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployment Status: Works as a computer programmer.\nMarital Status: Married for 25 years.\nLiving Arrangement: Lives with wife, recently purchased a new house.\nAlcohol Use: None.\nTobacco Use: Non-smoker.\nRecreational Drugs: None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeurological\nPatient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent.

There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.\n\nPLAN\n\nPituitary adenoma.\nWe discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death. The patient voiced understanding and wishes to proceed with trans-sphenoidal resection of the adenoma.\n\nBitemporal hemianopia.\nWe will have the patient scheduled this week to have visual field testing with ophthalmology. The preoperative visual field will serve as baseline for comparison of postoperative visual field testing to monitor for improvement in the bitemporal hemianopia. Additionally, we discussed that unfortunately no guarantees could be given that his vision would return.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n\u2022 Refer to ophthalmology for baseline visual field testing.\n\u2022 Schedule trans-sphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.\n",

The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.\n\nThe patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.\n\nThe patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nUterine fibroids.\nAnemia.\n\nSurgical\nCholecystectomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNone reported.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022\u202fCardiovascular:\u202f Positive for chest pain.\n\u2022\u202fGastrointestinal:\u202f Positive for difficulty swallowing.\n\u2022\u202fPsychiatric:\u202f Positive for stress.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\nMild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe patient\u2019s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nThe patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient\u2019s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.\n\nNon-cardiac chest pain.\n\nSuspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.\n\nPLAN\n\n\u2022 We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms.

she's just sh- a little shorter and chunkier , but i think that's a part of her syndrome .\n[doctor] yeah . yeah , i was reading all the things associated with the syndrome . it sounds like we're looking for continual- congenital anomalies wi- of the kidney and urinary tract . which is basically something is wrong with the plumbing .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] so the only way to know that , is to do a kidney ultrasound .\n[patient_guest] okay , that sounds okay .\n[doctor] okay . let me put that into the system , and then downstairs they can do the ultrasound .\n[patient_guest]

She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow\u2019s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where \u201cthe kidneys fuse into one\u201d and issues with their legs.\n\nThe patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates \u201ca lot\u201d.
