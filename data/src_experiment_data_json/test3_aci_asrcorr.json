you\n[doctor] alright yeah back pain especially like that like was it sharp could you tell me what kind of pain it was\n[patient] well yeah some days it was sharp some days it was n't some days it moves some days it does n't but it's mostly on the left\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] that's\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] unloving the spectrum that we have right here let's see if we can dig down and get some details well a couple of things i wan na ask have you been a bit more tired than lately\n[patient] no not recall\n[doctor] alright how about your appetite are you hungry or or not as hungry\n[patient] i i would say about his that that's pretty much unchanged\n[doctor] okay your appetite is unchanged alright what about your water consumption\n[patient] that i'm sorry what did you say\n[doctor] no it's fine how about your water consumption\n[patient] yes but i've been drinking a lot more water and i do realize that i i wake up sometimes during the night to you know use the restroom to pee more than i normally do\n[doctor] okay so we have noticed an increase in urine output okay how do you have like any normal activities are you playing any sports\n[patient] yeah i ride i ride a bike every so often\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so good yeah\n[doctor] okay and are you like watching any other sports like did you watch march madness\n[patient] no sorry\n[doctor] be still my heart okay that's fine i'll forgive you so\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] okay but how is school like are you like are are things going well like are you enjoying like your your time there\n[patient] yeah school is actually going well gotten good grades\n[doctor] nice\n[patient] although my my physics teachers socks cheese\n[doctor] they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you\n[patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] so\n[doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick\n[patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway\n[doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct\n[patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep\n[doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay\n[patient] sure\n[doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerulonephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment\n[patient] how much are all these tests going to cost\n[doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them\n[patient] okay that's that's good to know\n[doctor] yes\n[patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests\n[doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today\n[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and right after that i have to go to work\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i\n[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh\n[patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes\n[doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay\n[patient] got it\n[doctor] alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in\n[patient] do i need to get a shot today\n[doctor] no shots today just stopped\n[patient] okay and when do i have to come back for the results\n[doctor] i need you to come back in a week\n[patient] okay can we do that over the phone by the way\n[doctor] we could if if your results are normal but if we need to have additional conversations i'm gon na need you to come back\n[patient] excellent\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] thank you very much\n[doctor] no problem",

your knee here\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you gon na stick it through the screen or how you're gon na do this alright\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] alright then\n[doctor] i'm just i'm gon na i'm gon na grab your leg we're just gon na take it through just let it relax i'm just gon na take it through a little range of motion i'm gon na kinda poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay\n[patient] okay okay\n[doctor] alright now i'm poking i'm poking i'm poking so on the inside part here\n[patient] is this where it hurts\n[doctor] yeah like when you touch it it really hurts\n[patient] right there okay tell me what's worse here or here\n[doctor] on the inside\n[patient] okay so medial joint line tenderness\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] pes bursa nontender epicondyle nontender back of her knee nice and soft any pain back here\n[doctor] no i do n't think so\n[patient] okay popliteal space is nontender how about over on this side\n[doctor] no okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks\n[patient] yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it\n[doctor] all the way back\n[patient] okay let's see\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too\n[doctor] yeah that's fine\n[patient] okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax\n[doctor] mm-hmm valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee\n[patient] mm-hmm yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts\n[doctor] yeah sometimes\n[patient] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like\n[doctor] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts\n[patient] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it\n[doctor] hmmm\n[patient] you actually no\n[doctor] yeah it hurts no\n[patient] what about you i mean are you real weak\n[doctor] no i would say i'm pretty strong\n[patient] did you go to the gym\n[doctor] i go to the gym but i swim so the\n[patient] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay\n[doctor] yes sir work harder okay\n[patient] do you do you play sports in in college or high school\n[doctor] i did in high school\n[patient] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids\n[doctor] no\n[patient] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog\n[doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim\n[patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee\n[doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that\n[patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's pretty bad\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] we'll get we'll get to that too\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today\n[doctor] yes\n[patient] okay do i go into that to\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it\n[patient] you're only cup of this\n[doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like\n[patient] hmmm\n[doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up\n[patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] does that make sense\n[doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary\n[patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm\n[doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work\n[patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this\n[doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy\n[patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right\n[doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good\n[patient] did you get did you select you last night\n[doctor] i did\n[patient] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for\n[doctor] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful\n[patient] are you serious\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] rockets\n[doctor] i live in dallas yes\n[patient] yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls\n[doctor] no no\n[patient] my gosh alright we're gon na have to work on you\n[doctor] okay thanks\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] bye\n[patient] you got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight we'll talk about this later okay\n[doctor] yes sir\n[patient] alright very good any questions at all\n[doctor] no\n[patient] okay so",
            "tgt": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBeverly Howard is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain.\n\nThe patient reports that she fell off of a tandem bicycle and struck her right knee on a curb approximately 2 weeks ago. After the injury, she took ibuprofen and treated the wound, but the pain has persisted. She localizes her pain to the medial aspect of the knee. She also reports occasional clicking with full extension of the knee, as well as occasional instability with ambulation. The patient states that her pain is the worst when ambulating up an incline. She denies any previous right knee issues. She enjoys walking her dogs and swimming but has not done this since her injury.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient works in a Children's Hospital.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, clicking, and instability.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nSKIN: Warm, dry and intact\nMSK: \nExamination of the right knee: Tenderness along the medial joint line. Pes bursa is nontender. The epicondyle and posterior aspect of her knee are soft. Popliteal space is nontender. The lateral aspect of her knee is nontender. There is a dime-sized abrasion that is dry and appears to be 1 week old, over the medial patella. No scars. Full extension. Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial and lateral collateral ligament are intact. Laxity with posterior drawer testing. 1+ posterior drawer test. Negative Lachman test. Patella tracks fine. No crepitus. Negative McMurray test.\nExamination of the left knee: Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial collateral ligament is intact. Lateral collateral ligament is intact.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. Joint space is well preserved. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee pain, possible posterior cruciate ligament sprain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regard to her current symptoms. I explained that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommend we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible posterior cruciate ligament injury. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient be placed in a brace to provide increased support. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to work on her range of motion and strengthening. I advised her to ice her right knee a few times a day to reduce the swelling. She can continue taking her ibuprofen if she finds this helpful, but I am also going to send in a prescription medication she can take less frequently. The patient will follow up with me in 4 to 6 weeks to check on her progress.\n\nORDERS\n\nMRI, right knee\nPrescription medication",

The onset of his pain began yesterday after he went up for a rebound while playing basketball and felt a pop in his knee. He states that he experienced swelling and difficulty with ambulation following this incident. He locates his pain today to the medial aspect of his knee. His pain is described as aching and is rated at 4 out of 10. In terms of his swelling, he states that this has improved some. He is also able to weight-bear, but he finds that he is favoring his left leg while doing so. His tried treatments include Tylenol with some relief as well as rest.\n\nThe patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes. He reports that he does not check is blood pressure at home very often, but he typically runs 140 to 150 range over 80. He is taking 5 mg of Norvasc daily. In terms of his diet, he states that he enjoys eating whatever he likes. His most recent A1C was 7.2. He is taking metformin 500 mg daily, however there are days where he skips this because of gastrointestinal upset. He denies checking his blood sugar at home consistently and that when he does check he has been around 150.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of hypertension and diabetes.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports playing basketball, however this most recent event was the first time he played in 2 years.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports he is taking Norvasc 5 mg daily, metformin 500 mg daily, and Tylenol.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and swelling.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure is 140/80 today.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.\nRESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Pain with palpation over the medial aspect.

No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee MCL strain.\nDiabetes.\nHypertension.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to further evaluate for a possible MCL tear. In the meantime, he will continue with Tylenol for pain relief. I have also prescribed him meloxicam 15 mg for pain and swelling. He will be placed into a knee immobilizer and has been advised to remain non weight-bearing for the next couple of weeks.\n\nIn terms of his diabetes, he was advised to start logging his blood sugars daily and to avoid eating large amounts of strawberries. He will also be provided with a referral for a consult with a nutritionist.\n\nFor his hypertension, we are going to increase his Norvasc to 5 mg daily as his blood pressures have been elevated. We discussed our goal is for him to get closer to the 120/80 range.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review his MRI results.\n",

in the past like what were they\n[patient] so i i had a doc gave me some injections before i'm not sure what they were though\n[doctor] okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective\n[patient] no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it\n[doctor] okay but did the did the exercises help\n[patient] i mean i guess a little\n[doctor] okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications\n[patient] yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was\n[doctor] okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now\n[patient] i mean i sit at home all day\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] watch tv\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so not very active i've gained about eighty pounds the past year\n[doctor] okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions\n[patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis\n[doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad\n[patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though\n[doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking\n[patient] what type of smoking\n[doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] have you smoked\n[patient] next maybe that i have n't\n[doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before\n[patient] okay i smoked\n[doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it\n[patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked\n[doctor] okay you have\n[patient] too many questions are you the fit\n[doctor] i'm your doctor i have to\n[patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question\n[doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things\n[patient] sent them off yeah\n[doctor] pardon\n[patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen\n[doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt\n[patient] yeah it hurts\n[doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt\n[patient] a little bit\n[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up\n[patient] stop\n[doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the\n[patient] what does that mean like am i dying\n[doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay\n[patient] that's a big word\n[doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something\n[patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that\n[doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] can i get pain pills too\n[doctor] can you\n[patient] for pain\n[doctor] can you get what now\n[patient] pain pills\n[doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have\n[patient] i'd say it was n't effective\n[doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective\n[patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked\n[doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery\n[patient] i do n't want i know\n[doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] do you have any questions\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright\n[patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection\n[doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay thank you",

In terms of his bowel and bladder habits, he reports 1 episode of incontinence over the last 2 years which he believes was due to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He other denies any other changes and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has tried an injection in the past, but notes that he does not like needles and had to be held down. Pain medication was tried but he is unable to recall the name of the medication. He also attended physical therapy with minimal relief. Currently he states that he is not very active and tends to watch tv all day.

The nature of the procedure was discussed. A prescription was given today to help with his anxiety during the injection as he states he does not tolerate needles. We also had a long discussion regarding pain medication. I advised him that we can do up to 4 injections per year and that we need to hold off on proceeding with pain medication until we assess his progress. I also explained to him that pain medication is not a long term solution and that if he remains symptomatic, it is possible surgery would be recommended.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will return for follow-up after to assess his progress after his spinal injection.\n",

now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful\n[doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck\n[patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts\n[doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids\n[patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake\n[doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though\n[patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them\n[doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of cisplatin and etoposide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that\n[patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay\n[doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation pneumonitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five gray yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before\n[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight\n[doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright so we will get you those medications those prescriptions and then we will see you back in two weeks\n[patient] okay great thank you\n[doctor] thanks",

about what's happening\n[patient] yeah i've had blood high blood pressure for a long time my provider gave me chlorthalidone i do n't really take it because it gives me a stomachache but yeah i get headaches right here on the top of my head they kinda come and go they're throbbing tylenol helps the headache\n[doctor] okay alright and then so how long have you had this headache has this been recent or like acute or you've been having this for since you've had your blood pressures\n[patient] hmmm it's been on and off for about a month\n[doctor] a month okay alright and then are you having any other kind of symptoms with that like are you having any kind of you know dizziness lightheadedness any nausea vomiting\n[patient] yeah sometimes i feel dizzy and my vision gets a little blurry\n[doctor] okay alright how about like chest pain or shortness of breath are you experiencing any of that when you have these headaches in your blood pressure\n[patient] chest pain or shortness of breath\n[doctor] okay very good alright and then you said you were you've taken some tylenol for that and you said it did help a little bit or did n't sorry\n[patient] it does help\n[doctor] it does help good very good so how often are you taking your your medication are you taking that as prescribed like daily it sounds like you missed a few times but for the most part are you taking it\n[patient] yeah i forget a lot so i probably take it like every other day\n[doctor] okay every other day alright and then are you also now i know you also have some diabetes so are you how are you doing with that one are you pretty much taking your metformin everyday\n[patient] hmmm i probably take it when i take my other medicine like every other day\n[doctor] every other day okay so i do see that you know the nurse took your your vital signs this morning that your blood pressure is running quite a bit high it was like one seventy two over ninety eight so that's that's really a little higher than where we want it to be especially that you're on your medication but what we're gon na do is we're gon na take i'm gon na take a look at you real quick and then we can discuss you know maybe there's some changes that we can do in terms of your current regimen how about diet and your have you been sticking with that low sodium diet at all\n[patient] no i love mcdonald's i eat it all the time\n[doctor] i love mcdonald's too my favorite is big mac i do n't know about you but i got ta have my big mac with those large fries which you what's your favorite mcdonald's treat there\n[patient] i need to think of what fully of fish i love flare of fish\n[doctor] well at least you're eating the fish but but they can be very high in sodium especially the fast foods so we'll have to talk about maybe they can look at you know some some diet changes as well so the other thing is for your for your blood sugar here i see that you know you're running a bit high as well it looks like you're like you're about one seventy this morning and i i i i assume that you were fasting last night is that right okay so that's that's a little higher than what we want it's not bad it's below two hundred but it's getting kinda close to the borderline from where our limit is so we will take we take a look at that and also we'll figure out what we can do with that as well alright so at this point how about are you how is how is work how is life it's been good otherwise how's the family\n[patient] they are good i did eat a lot of my kids easter candy over the weekend so maybe that's why my sugar is high\n[doctor] okay alright great alright alright just just around easter okay not not too much during the the year hopefully\n[patient] yeah i try\n[doctor] well that's good so let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you real quick here okay and so i'm looking at your vital signs it looks like your blood pressure i we mentioned that today is pretty high your heart rate looks good it's with it's within normal limits here and then your oxygenation is fine so you did mention you did n't have any shortness of breath so that's good so let me just feel around your neck real quick here i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention on your neck exam i no carotid bruits so that's good let me go ahead and listen to your lungs and your heart here real quick alright so on your auscultation of your lungs they're clear bilaterally on your heart exam though i i do sense a two out of six systolic ejection murmur now that was also there last year so it has n't changed any so we'll just keep monitoring that one and then let me take a look at your extremities here real quick theresa so let me look at your hands you got a little bit of slight edema bilaterally on your upper extremities but let me look at your legs here okay so you have a one plus pitting edema noted here on your legs bilaterally so that means you're retaining a lot of that salt that you're eating unfortunately okay so so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here so definitely what you're experiencing is some uncontrolled hypertension now most of the time you know it's multifactorial right it's your diet it could be the medication regimen if you're not following that and then it might be that we are gon na need to change the medication around and also change your diet but i would like to start with going ahead and i want to continue your current medication regimen today i do wan na really encourage that you do take that everyday maybe set a reminder like on your you know do you use your iphone a lot for your reminders and things maybe we can go ahead and do that get a reminder make sure that you take that everyday but with that i would like to go ahead and also monitor your blood pressure let's do it three times a week it can be much when we do it everyday but maybe three times a week do you have a blood pressure monitor at home\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so i can recommend some really good ones nowadays that you can use at home and they're not that expensive and at least it'll give you some you know idea of what your blood pressure is running at and then i want you to come back like in a month because i wan na go ahead and see how your blood pressure is doing now that you know you're you you're taking your blood pressure medication everyday the other thing is i do wan na go ahead and have a nutritionist come and talk to you about you may maybe some dietary changes i'd like for you to start a \u2013 diet it's really to to help you know a lot of reduce a lot of that sodium intake when you're when you're when you're taking in your food so a nutritionist is gon na be able to help you figure out some foods that you know that you may like that you can actually use as an alternative besides the mcdonald's although you can have that once in a blue moon but you know not not too often okay\n[patient] okay sounds good\n[doctor] great and then for your diabetes i wan na go ahead and let's go ahead and increase your your metformin to fifteen hundred milligrams i think all for that too i want you to go ahead and continue taking your blood sugars to make sure as as you normally would to make sure that you know that change in medication is is actually being effective alright do you have any other questions for me at this time\n[patient] nope\n[doctor] okay great well i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and and i'll have the scheduler schedule you for a one month follow-up we'll take a look and see how

i've been taking it maybe like once a week but the past three weeks it's been really high than usual so i was a little worried\n[doctor] do you remember the numbers that you're getting on your blood pressure readings\n[patient] yeah so one of them was like one sixty over eighty seven and then the last one was like one seventy five over ninety two\n[doctor] okay so it's really high i was looking back and it looks like your blood pressure was pretty normal last time we saw you is one twenty four over eighty two have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine the lisinopril that you've been prescribed\n[patient] i have but sometimes i forget i'm i'm embarrassed to tell you that but yeah sometimes i forget i get busy like especially on the weekends i'm very good during the week but on the weekends i tend to forget it and that's when i'm most busy too\n[doctor] yeah well i'm also curious you know you have diabetes have you been checking your blood sugar\n[patient] yeah i have because i thought maybe you know that's why i'm getting the headaches maybe my sugar was too low or maybe too high but my sugar has been okay it's been running like one twenty sometimes it does get down to like one hundred\n[doctor] okay and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that\n[patient] not really so much it's it's been pretty much the same but pretty normal\n[doctor] okay and when you get these headaches what are you taking for them\n[patient] well i take my tylenol hoping it'll just you know go away and then it does some just for a little bit but then it it just goes throughout the day and i start to get them again\n[doctor] okay and when you first had the headaches what would you rate the headache at zero no pain ten the worst pain ever\n[patient] i would say when i first get them it's about i would say a seven out of ten\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] and then after you take the tylenol what does it go down to\n[patient] it goes down to probably about a four maybe five it i still feel it i still feel annoying but it's not as pounding as as it normally would be\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] if i did n't take the tylenol\n[doctor] yeah and have you ever had headaches like this before\n[patient] not like this you know you know as you know sometimes i get migraine but i know i never really take anything for it that's like once a year or once or every two years but not like not like this one headaches like this one\n[doctor] okay and have you had any congestion anything like that cough runny nose\n[patient] yeah i thought maybe because you know now it's springtime and i tend to get my allergies but it it's it's very different and i've not actually had any like runny nose or cough or congestion along with the headache\n[doctor] okay if you tap on your forehead do you have any tenderness\n[patient] right here\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] just a little not really too much\n[doctor] okay if you tap down here on these bones your cheek bones any tenderness there\n[patient] a little bit not as much as i guess if i tap up here\n[doctor] okay and then if you kinda push on your neck around here any tenderness\n[patient] it it's a little tender but it's not it is a little bit i'd say\n[doctor] okay okay so you do n't have any frontal sinus tenderness no maxillary sinus tenderness it sounds like you do n't have any lymphadenopathy that would just be if your lymph nodes were tender so yeah you know let's just talk about a few things that i wan na do and then i want you to actually come in and and be seen by doctor ruth so first off your headache i think taking tylenol is great you can keep taking that you know your lisinopril you're on twenty milligrams once a day which is a medium dose but i think we can increase that so for your hypertension and your headaches i'm gon na have you increase your lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] and then i want you to keep checking your blood pressure and i wan na order some blood tests i'd like to get some just normal blood work we'll get a hemoglobin a1c some laboratory tests

more in this visit would that be okay with you\n[patient] sure that's fine\n[doctor] okay great so so karen tell me about your abdominal pain what's been happening\n[patient] well it started about ten days ago with just some mild discomfort in on my right side and it seems to be getting worse over the last couple of days especially\n[doctor] okay and how bad would you say the pain is like it's a zero to ten on a scale today\n[patient] yeah it it waxes and wanes in severity it it's in general probably around a four or a five but sometimes it gets up as high as a seven or eight\n[doctor] okay is there anything that you notice that makes that pain worse or better like rest or movement or eating or anything else\n[patient] it's usually a little worse after a meal\n[doctor] hmmm okay\n[patient] in the morning before i've eaten it's it's not too bad but during the day after a meal it gets worse\n[doctor] okay alright and do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know any or anywhere\n[patient] it's pretty low it might radiate a little bit to the left but otherwise it's pretty localized to the right side\n[doctor] okay and have you had any nausea or vomiting along with the pain\n[patient] i've had some nausea and a little bit of heartburn but no vomiting\n[doctor] okay and and this is this is this is worse with you said worse worse with meals and is there anything else anything else that that makes it worse\n[patient] it is a little tender if i if i press on it and certain positions seem to make it a little worse when i'm most when it's the highest\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] pain\n[doctor] okay sure any pain with urination or any blood in your urine\n[patient] no no urinary symptoms\n[doctor] okay and how about any diarrhea and any of that or blood in your stool no\n[patient] no change in bowels\n[doctor] okay alright and so would you say that your appetite has been normal or decreased or any different\n[patient] well since i'm a little nauseated i'm not quite as hungry and i feel just kind of a little overall a little more fatigued over the last week\n[doctor] okay okay you did n't overeat you know during the super bowl last weekend did you that was i know probably lots of junk food floating around if your house is anything like mine\n[patient] well once the packers are out of the playoffs i do n't watch the super bowl so nothing i have n't eaten anything unusual\n[doctor] okay well that's good that's good and and no no travel i know you're a big big travel travel fan you know i remember you telling me about your trip to europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently\n[patient] not recently just back to wisconsin but no unusual travel or other exposures\n[doctor] okay alright great and okay so so tell me about your migraines how have they been are you still taking the sumatriptan you know as needed when when you developed migraine you have have you had a migraine recently\n[patient] i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's it's been it they've been pretty rare\n[doctor] okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been\n[patient] i have not been checking them daily i i probably check it about two or three times a week\n[doctor] hmmm\n[patient] and they're pretty good the upper number is usually around in the one twenties or low one thirties and the lower number usually in the seventies\n[doctor] okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that\n[patient] yeah actually i was going to ask you about that if i could get a refill that would be great\n[doctor] sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct\n[patient] correct\n[doctor] okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay yeah you have i would call an equivocal murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness you have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no cva tenderness on your back exam as well and so we will talk about about that i am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that that i find on your abdominal exam the remainder of your exam karen is pretty normal and unremarkable and and so that's good let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan so first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that i'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder so i'm gon na order some blood tests and an ultrasound today i'm gon na

you are not great okay well how long have you been having some shortness of breath\n[patient] it's been about a week\n[doctor] it's been about a week okay now have you ever experienced these symptoms before\n[patient] yeah this happened about six months ago and i came in and they changed my lasix dose and i seemed to get better\n[doctor] okay alright so let's talk a little bit about that now i know that you have a history of coronary disease you know you had had a heart attack back in twenty eighteen we put that stent in your right coronary artery i know that the pumping function of your heart was a little low you know that what we call that ejection fraction was about thirty five percent have you been watching your salt intake\n[patient] yeah but you know it's been the holidays the last couple of weeks and you know i we've had a bunch of family get togethers and i i do n't think my diet has been everything it should have been\n[doctor] okay alright now have you noticed any swelling in your legs\n[patient] yes definitely\n[doctor] okay and are you taking the lasix now i know that we had increased it to about forty milligrams once a day are you taking it\n[patient] yeah i take it everyday\n[doctor] you take it everyday okay do you notice that you're urinating any less recently\n[patient] no it seems about the same\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you know i i urinate at night you know at least once sometimes twice a night that's a little more it happened before\n[doctor] okay alright and do you feel short of breath at rest or is it mostly when you're just walking around\n[patient] walking around stairs in particular walking quickly\n[doctor] okay and how about when you're sleeping at night are you able to lay flat or do you have to sit up a little bit\n[patient] i gone from one pillow to two pillows\n[doctor] okay alright and do you ever wake up really short of breath does it ever wake you up\n[patient] it did that six months ago it has not done that so far this time\n[doctor] okay alright now tell me a little bit about when was the last time you saw your nephrologist\n[patient] about about a month ago\n[doctor] okay because as you know you know we we do talk about the fact that you have some kidney dysfunction about stage three so it's gon na be important for you to continue to follow up with your kidney doctor now are you how are you doing staying away from things like motrin and advil i know that you had had some knee pain in the past and you know how are you doing staying away from those medications\n[patient] yeah everybody has told me not to use it so i do n't except when i have pretty bad pain i had an episode about a week ago some pain in my feet actually and i i had to take motrin to get rid of it so yeah i took motrin for a while and i stopped as quickly as i could\n[doctor] okay now are you able to take tylenol do you not feel any relief from tylenol when you take it\n[patient] yeah tylenol's lovely it just is not very effective\n[doctor] okay alright yeah because i think we really want you to stay away from that those anti-inflammatories because that can make your kidney function worse and obviously you know we do n't wan na see you go on dialysis or anything like that so we'll have\n[patient] mean neither\n[doctor] right so we'll have to you know really work on that now tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet\n[patient] nobody's really talked to me about that so\n[doctor] okay yeah so you want\n[patient] i did n't know what high potassium foods are\n[doctor] okay i'm sorry i've never talked to you about that in the past i that's my fault so yeah so you wan na make sure you stay away from things like bananas oranges you know potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing and so you know because with your kidney function you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you do n't get rid of the potassium as you should you know\n[patient] something to eat\n[doctor] what's that\n[patient] is there anything left is there anything left over that i ca n't eat\n[doctor] so yeah you can eat you know how about this how about we give you a a referral to a dietitian and they can help you with that\n[patient] sounds good\n[doctor] now are you watching the nba playoff should i or should i not bring that up i is that a sensitive subject i mean i'm a self expand and and we did sweep the nuts so\n[patient] yeah well i mean that's fan and i could n't sleep last night but you know\n[doctor] okay well maybe we should n't talk about\n[patient] kinda used to it you know where they where the favorite to win and then like that\n[doctor] yeah i know i i i will say i think jason tatum and jaylen brown paid played phenomenally so i do think that they help with the cell fix over the edge so but that's all we'll talk about that what's that\n[patient] i said yeah too bad they did\n[doctor] yeah alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you okay so you know looking at your vital signs here in the office you know your your blood pressure is about one thirty five over eighty so it's it's not too bad and maybe like to see it a little bit lower i'm just gon na be calling out my physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so on your neck exam i appreciate some jugular venous distention up to about nine centimeters there are no carotid bruits on your lung exam i do appreciate bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when you cough on your heart exam i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally so frank what does that mean all that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're retaining fluid now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that okay so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you okay so for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath i do believe you're having a an acute heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix from forty milligrams a day to eighty milligrams a day and i want you to call me in two days and let me know how your weight has been with increasing the diuretic now if you start to have worsening shortness of breath before that i want you to yeah call me we may have to admit you to the hospital for some intravenous diuretics okay i also wan na go ahead and just obtain\n[patient] salt on lasix all at once am i take it all at once or do i divide it up\n[doctor] how about you start taking the the increased dose in the morning and then we'll see how you do and if necessary i'll have to add a second dose in the afternoon that you can take around four o'clock in the afternoon i do n't want you to take it too late at night because then you will be going to the bathroom all night okay\n[patient] that sounds correct\n[doctor] so i also want to go ahead and order a chest x-ray just to make sure that we are not missing anything else okay for your second problem of your coronary artery disease you know it sounds like you're doing well except for this heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and order another echocardiogram to check out that heart murmur that i hear on your physical exam just to make sure that that's not getting any worse and to make sure that the pumping function of your heart is stable and i'm gon na go ahead and call doctor white and let them know that i want you to be seen by them okay okay and then for your third problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i want you to go ahead and try to you know do n't please do n't take anymore motrin or advil i do want you to try to stick with tylenol and if you're still having a significant problem with with some pain i want you to call me and we'll talk about some alternative medications that we can use or therapies okay i will also want to go ahead and order a complete metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable does that sound okay\n[patient] that sounds good do you have any idea what was going on with my foot pain before\n[doctor] well how long have you been having it how long you've been having that foot pain\n[patient] that's why i took the motrin it lasted you know four five days slowly went away\n[doctor] it was in both of your feet\n[patient] one\n[doctor] one and where in your foot was was it\n[patient] just in front of the big toe\n[doctor] just in front of the big toe okay have you ever had a history of gout\n[patient] nobody has told me about that\n[doctor] okay alright well it sounds like it could've been gout you know with your chronic kidneys chronic kidney disease it it's a possibility so for this possible gout flare for your fourth problem of your possible gout flare let's go ahead i wan na just go ahead and order a uric acid just to see and it's something that we can talk about there is an alternative medication that you can take with your kidney function that that would n't hurt it that would n't injure it any further and i think it would work just the same\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay any other questions\n[patient] just as long as you think i'm gon na get better\n[doctor] i think you're gon na get better yes i think we're gon na you know i really want you to watch your salt intake and i'm gon na go ahead and order that dietary dietitian referral so that you can get your diet under control but you really have to watch your salt intake i think that that's kind of what this heart failure exacerbation is about maybe a little dietary indiscretion\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay anything else\n[patient] yeah no that's good thank you\n[doctor] okay you're welcome bye",

Acute heart failure exacerbation.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient\u2019s physical examination today suggests he is retaining fluid. His shortness of breath is also the result of an acute heart failure exacerbation. His recent dietary indiscretion may have contributed to this development.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that he should increase his diuretic in the morning so that any increased urinary frequency will not interrupt his sleep at night. I encouraged the patient to limit his salt intake.\n- Medical Treatment: The patient will increase his Lasix from 40 mg a day to 80 mg a day. We will see how he does with the increased dose in the morning before adding a second increased dose in the afternoon. Chest x-ray ordered to rule out any other etiologies.\n\n2. Coronary artery disease.\n- Medical Reasoning: He is doing well except for the heart failure exacerbation.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to limit his intake of salty foods.\n- Medical Treatment: Repeat echocardiogram ordered for further evaluation of the heart murmur heard on his physical exam.

Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.\n- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be stable.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I reminded the patient it is important to routinely follow up with his nephrologist. I advised him that he should limit intake of any potassium rich foods including bananas, oranges, and potatoes as they can affect his kidney function. I also recommended he avoid the use of any anti-inflammatories such as Motrin or Advil as they can contribute to worsening kidney function. If his pain does not resolve with Tylenol, I want him to call me, and we can discuss some alternative medications or therapies.\n- Medical Treatment: The patient was provided with a referral to a dietician for assistance with his dietary needs. Tylenol can be taken for pain. Complete metabolic panel is ordered to ensure kidney function is stable.\n\n4. Possible gout flare.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient\u2019s recent great toe pain may have been a possible gout flare related to his chronic kidney disease.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that there is an alternative medication he could take to protect his kidney function that would not result in a gout flare.\n- Medical Treatment: Uric acid test ordered.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nI want him to call me in 2 days and let me know how his weight has been with increasing the diuretic.

take the baby aspirin at night is that okay\n[doctor] yeah that's perfect as long as you take it once a day and you're able to afford the brilinta any issues with cost with that\n[patient] no i so far so good\n[doctor] okay alright so it's really gon na be really important for you to go ahead and continue to take these medications to prevent that stent from clogging again okay or prevent that stent from closing because we do n't want you to have another heart attack okay\n[patient] okay yeah\n[doctor] okay and how about watching your diet are you able to watch your salt intake i know that you really liked a good pizza every now and again are you\n[patient] yeah i i have eaten pizza a few times what i'm trying to do is really be diligent and eat well throughout the week and then i have had pizza a few times on the weekends is that okay\n[doctor] you can have a piece here and there you know the pumping function of your heart was pretty normal when i saw from the hospital your ejection fraction that's the pumping function of your heart was at about fifty percent which is you know low normal but not bad so that's good so okay just i would just watch your salt intake okay\n[patient] okay yeah i've been eating a lot of vegetables and and chicken without salt on it\n[doctor] okay great and then you know i i'm i'm glad that you're taking it easy now remind me this might cause you

wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your blood pressure here in the office your blood pressure looks good it's about one twenty seven over sixty which is pretty good on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention there is no carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally and on your musculoskeletal exam your right radial artery cardiac cath site is clean dry and intact there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse now what does that mean betty so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack but i looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild mitral regurgitation which is just you know a little floppy valve which is is fine we'll just keep an eye on that and then everything else for the most part looks good so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction i wan na go ahead and continue with your aspirin continue on your brilinta you're gon na stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin you're gon na take lifelong until i tell you to okay i wan na go ahead and have you continue on the crestor forty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months okay do you have any questions about that\n[patient] yeah do you think i can no that sounds good i have one other more question though\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] do you think that i can swim again i miss swimming\n[doctor] yeah so at this point you're you know you're out like two weeks and your and your cath site is looks good so you can go ahead and and resume swimming now with that being said i would want you to just do a few laps here and there i do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's gon na give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising and they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab does that sounds like something that you can do\n[patient] yeah i think i have to\n[doctor] okay i agree alright i also want you to go ahead and continue with your toprol fifty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and order a some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet and i want to see you again in probably six weeks okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay any questions\n[patient] no i think that's it thank you very much\n[doctor] okay take care

starting i'm just gon na check start with your sinuses and when i press here do you have any pain any tenderness when i do that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] no okay so no frontal sinus tenderness how about when i press on the on your cheeks here\n[patient] maybe a little bit just a little bit\n[doctor] on both sides\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness alright and i'm just gon na take a look at in your mouth if you can open up okay so i do see some do have some erythema of the pharynx and the tonsils are symmetrical i do n't appreciate any exudates now i'm just checking your neck and i do appreciate some anterior cervical adenopathy alright and i'm just gon na take a listen to you alright so listening to your heart so you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and you do still have that two out of six systolic ejection murmur at the left base now i'm taking listen to your lungs and on your lungs exam okay your lungs are nice and clear i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales or rhonchi alright and just looking at your lower extremities i do n't appreciate any edema there so let's talk about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of the cough so looking at your cough it does seem like you have a upper respiratory infection and so basically that's a virus most likely it's a virus that's causing your symptoms especially being around someone else who has similar symptoms and seems like most likely they spread it to you so i want you to continue with doing a lot of the time is just letting the virus run it's course and taking things just to help with your symptoms so drinking lots of fluids that's gon na help you trying i know you've been doing a cough medicine you can even try another one you have to be careful with the blood pressure and diabetes so you can try like a coricidin hbp can help with the cough and lots of rest okay lots of rest now we are in a current pandemic and so something i can check for you if you're okay with that is checking for covid if that's okay with you\n[patient] yes i'm okay with that\n[doctor] okay so we will check you for that today and see how you're doing with that and then we will give you those results okay any questions about that\n[patient] no questions\n[doctor] no okay so for problem number two the type two diabetes so we'll continue you on your metformin five hundred milligrams daily or twice a day you had blood work at your last visit so you'll be due at your next visit for your hemoglobin a1c and that's the check the sugars on your red blood cells so we do that about every three months so at your next visit we'll check that for you and then we will go from there but it seems like you're doing well with that now as far as problem number three your high blood pressure so your blood pressure is elevated here and it sounds like it's been you know creeping up just a little bit at home as well you're on a very tiny dose of the hydrochlorothiazide so what i would like to do is increase it to twenty five milligrams once a day again i would recommend that you take it in the morning just because you may have noticed it can make you urinate quite a bit and then i would love for you to just continue checking as you have been a few times a week just checking your blood pressure at different times of the day so we can continue to see how you do with that okay\n[patient] okay alright that sounds\n[doctor] alright any questions for me\n[patient] no questions\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] thank you alright so at this point now i'm just gon na press the\n[doctor] i'm gon na",

pressures so hi there mister thompson it's nice to see you again listen i understand you're having some trouble with your blood pressure control i would like to discuss that with you but first i want to ask you i'd like to use this app this new fancy app that's gon na help me focus on you a bit more in our conversation would that be okay with you\n[patient] yes that's fine\n[doctor] okay great it's gon na record our conversation okay perfect so jerry tell me mister thompson tell me about your blood pressure readings recently i understand you're concerned about them they have been up they have been down what's going on and any other symptoms\n[patient] normally my blood pressure has been very well controlled over about the last three to four weeks there have been periods where i felt a little lightheaded slight headache and when i checked my blood pressure the upper number has been occasionally over one eighty which is way past you know what any of the numbers have been in the past\n[doctor] okay okay and okay and yeah that does sound unusual for you and so it's been high but you've also felt lightheaded at times have you checked your blood pressure when you were feeling lightheaded was it was it low at those times or have you done that\n[patient] i've done it both when i felt fine and then when i had the lightheaded episodes actually it's been on the high side\n[doctor] okay alright understood and you have n't passed out or anything have you\n[patient] not recently\n[doctor] okay and have you had any chest pain or trouble breathing along with you know your elevated blood pressure\n[patient] sometimes a little heaviness in my chest but no no nothing sustained and i do n't have any respiratory or breathing difficulty\n[doctor] okay excellent and how about any headaches or other neurologic symptoms like numbness or weakness or you know balance instability or anything like that\n[patient] little unsteady when i get the dizziness and a slight headache when the blood pressure numbers have been a little higher\n[doctor] okay and when you say dizzy are you feeling lightheaded like you might pass out or you feeling that the world spinning around you or what\n[patient] just a little fuzzy where you just feel more lightheaded\n[doctor] okay alright understood and you've not had any any fever or nausea vomiting anything like that have you or diarrhea\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and are you feeling any palpitations or your heart racing anything unusual there\n[patient] not usually no\n[doctor] okay and are you still taking the lisinopril twenty milligrams once per day no actually i see we last visit we increased that to twice per day you're still taking that lisinopril twenty milligrams twice per day\n[patient] yes i am\n[doctor] okay you are not missing doses or anything are you by chance\n[patient] very rarely\n[doctor] okay great great you're still using that pill box that we suggested i think you had a pretty good system going there maybe maybe you're using that app now to take to keep track of one when to take your medicine are you doing that\n[patient] yes yeah i've i've used the pillbox and then tried the app it was a little confusing but i'm i'm pretty much on on track with staying on my medication schedule pretty accurately\n[doctor] that's great i think i think i remember you saying it was tricky to get that app set up but then your grandson helped you with it and those kids amazing what they can do these days right anything like that i always trust them my kids before me so hey by the way how did he do in his softball or in his in his little league tournament last month i think you said he had a big tournament coming up how did that go\n[patient] they they did great they they got all the way to the finals and then the team that the team that beat them was probably a little older a little bit more season but they had a great time\n[doctor] wow wow how fun that's fantastic well congrats good stuff alright well listen so so you're still taking your your lisinopril how about for your hyperlipidemia your your high cholesterol there are you still taking that atorvastatin\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay excellent and your osteoarthritis i know you've been you know a golfer in the past and you know you wan na get out on the course and things is that still under control are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still\n[patient] most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that i have to maybe play less play less or or skip a day\n[doctor] yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right\n[patient] correct\n[doctor] okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound\n[patient] i do n't think so anything that i need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things\n[doctor] yeah you know be sure you're staying well hydrated you know six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you you know when when it warms up you're certainly gon na prespire more and lose lose more fluid so so i would i would recommend that you continue to have you know a a standard six to eight glasses of of fluid intake per day but yeah that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated you might wan na increase that if you have an increased activity level so alright any other questions for me\n[patient] how much beer should i drink\n[doctor] probably not the best thing with you know with with with your high blood pressure fluctuating the way it is so not more than a couple drinks a week hate to tell you\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright okay great seeing you we'll see you back see you in a couple of weeks you take care",

having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today\n[patient] yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment\n[doctor] okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on\n[patient] well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me\n[doctor] okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street\n[patient] my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was\n[doctor] it was\n[patient] it was just phenomenal\n[doctor] it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's\n[patient] mm-hmm\n[doctor] but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon\n[patient] yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for\n[doctor] i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day\n[patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped\n[doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis\n[patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it\n[doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me\n[patient] okay that's a bright light\n[doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection\n[patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye\n[doctor] well\n[patient] what i mean not not yeah literally stick a needle in your eye\n[doctor] yeah literally yeah\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection\n[patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good\n[doctor] okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today\n[patient] okay okay\n[doctor] sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes\n[patient] okay thank you very much\n[doctor] thank you",

Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLow back pain, left side.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol.",

you remember what you were doing when the pain started\n[patient] i you know i ca n't think about anything specifically but i am very active and i also have been renovating my basement so i have been doing a lot with that\n[doctor] wow okay and do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything\n[patient] no no trauma that i can think of at all\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i do n't remember hitting it either\n[doctor] okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before\n[patient] you know i'm active and will have aches and pains here and there but nothing that some tylenol ca n't take care of\n[doctor] okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder\n[patient] it is\n[doctor] okay are you able to move that left arm for me\n[patient] you know anytime i try reaching for something or lifting anything i have a lot of pain and i do n't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it it really hurts\n[doctor] okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go\n[patient] it's all the time and if there is any pressure like when i try to sleep at night i ca n't even lay i'm a side sleeper and it i really gives me a hard time because i'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there\n[doctor] okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all\n[patient] i ca n't\n[doctor] alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side\n[patient] i mean it's always there but when i sleep directly on it the pain goes up\n[doctor] okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain\n[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol and i'll take two extra strengths tylenol every six to eight hours\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and it does help take the edge off\n[doctor] okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level\n[patient] without any tylenol i would say my pain is like a three\n[doctor] okay and then with tylenol with that\n[patient] i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three\n[doctor] okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift\n[patient] yeah it just time we've been living in this house for some time now and you know with the pandemic we've been home and so decided to do some work\n[doctor] nice have you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here\n[patient] no\n[doctor] yeah it's nice my wife and i were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago so everything's fully stocked and if you guys are doing some renovations you might run down there and you know save big money at home depot\n[patient] i definitely will check that out\n[doctor] so are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay so if you do n't mind i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam i've reviewed your vitals everything looks good there and i'm gon na do a focused exam of your left shoulder now you have limited active and passive range of motion there is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints and you have good hand grip bilaterally neurovascular exam of your left arm your cap refill is brisk in less than three seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality so let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy this means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attach to the shoulder muscles i'm gon na go ahead and order an mri of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder i'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay now during that time i want you to continue to take tylenol p.r.n . if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan\n[patient] yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away\n[doctor] i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do\n[patient] okay alright\n[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and i'll see you in about two about two weeks\n[patient] alright thank you\n[doctor] thank you",

She denies any known injury or trauma; however, she is very active and is currently renovating her basement. She denies any associated numbness or tingling as well. While movements such as reaching and lifting exacerbate her pain, full flexion of the shoulder is the most severe. Her pain is also exacerbated if she lays on her shoulder, which subsequently causes sleep disturbance due to her being uncomfortable. She typically takes Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours, for aches and pains associated with her active lifestyle, and doing so reduces her shoulder pain to 2-3/10 on the pain scale. Without medication, she rates her pain as 7/10.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient denies any previous trauma or injury to left shoulder.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that she has a very active lifestyle.

looking here at your vital signs you know you do n't have a fever here in the office which is good your temperature is ninety eight . four on your blood pressure it seems like you are doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure your blood pressure is right where it should be it's about one twenty five over sixty two which is good your heart rate is nice and slow in the eighties and your oxygenation is fine it's ninety seven percent on room air so all of that is is really good now on on your facial exam i'm just pressing on your face here do you have any pain to palpation\n[patient] just right underneath my eyes\n[doctor] on one on what side\n[patient] actually both\n[doctor] okay okay on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam there are there is erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam can you open up your mouth on your throat exam the the uvula is midline there is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsillar space on neck examination i do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and on your lung exam there is coarse rhonchi present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when i press here\n[patient] yep\n[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation on the right knee and i'm just gon na move it all around does that hurt\n[patient] little bit yeah\n[doctor] okay so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated ecchymosis to the right medial knee there is no evidence of an effusion okay so billy what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your in your lungs which we will talk about okay and then and as far as your knee exam it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues okay so for your first problem of your cough you know i do believe that you just have a a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis i really just wan na go ahead and just you know recommend some supportive care you can continue to take over the counter medications we can prescribe guaifenesin six hundred six hundred milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound\n[patient] that sounds good\n[doctor] okay so for your second problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have a a a right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning and i really wan na just go ahead and and i'll prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area and i'm gon na go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did n't injure any bones although i do n't think you did but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray how does that sound\n[patient] okay that sounds like good good plan\n[doctor] okay and then for your third problem of your hypertension let's just continue on the lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and lastly your fourth problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c just to make sure we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin and i really want you to try to monitor your sugar intake and report your blood sugars to me through the patient portal how does that sound\n[patient] okay i'll try that i try my best\n[doctor] alright that sounds good i'll i'll be in touch with you with those results okay\n[patient] okay appreciate it\n[doctor] alright take care bye",

that\n[patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines\n[doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past\n[patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past\n[doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they\n[patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of\n[doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right\n[patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well\n[doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass\n[patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out\n[doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend\n[patient] just getting this pain under control\n[doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt\n[patient] no no no pain\n[doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in\n[patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender\n[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you\n[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible\n[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer\n[patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing\n[doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to\n[patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want\n[doctor] what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me\n[patient] no i'm friend\n[doctor] alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good\n[patient] perfect thank you\n[doctor] alright great",

He also recalls one episode in which the pain radiated down into one of his testicles. Although his pain is intermittent depending on his fluid intake and activity level, he rates the pain as a 4/10 at its worst. Otherwise, the pain is a 1-2/10. He denies any pain with urination, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or fevers, but recalls possibly having chills at one point. Over-the-counter ibuprofen provides partial relief of his pain. Of note, the patient has a personal history of kidney stones, some which were passed independently, usually within a week, while others required surgical intervention or lithotripsy. He also has several family members with a histories of kidney stones.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient has a personal history of kidney stones treated conservatively, surgically, and with lithotripsy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nThe patient has a significant family history of kidney stones.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports chills. Denies fever\nGastrointestinal: Denies nausea or vomiting.\nGenitourinary: Reports right flank pain. Denies dysuria or hematuria.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure: Slightly elevated\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGI/GU: No tenderness to palpation of the abdomen.\nMSK: Examination of the right flank: CVA tenderness.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT scan of the right flank was reviewed today, 05/06/2022. It revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located on the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nKidney stone, right side.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and CT scan findings today, we discussed the diagnosis and treatment plan. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively at this point. I advised him to continue drinking plenty of fluids so he can hopefully pass the stone. He has been controlling his pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen and should continue to do so. I also prescribed tramadol 50 mg for any breakthrough pain. His primary care physician provided him with a strainer and I advised him to continue using this as well. I want to order a BMP, a urinalysis, and a urine culture to rule out any need for antibiotics. We will have him follow up in 2 weeks for re-evaluation. If he has not passed the kidney stone at that time, we can consider proceeding with lithotripsy.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks.",

now i you mentioned that you had taken some ibuprofen for that pain now let's talk a little bit about your pain rating okay zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life can you rate your pain for me without any tylenol or advil or any nsaid can you rate your pain for me\n[patient] about a six\n[doctor] okay now when you take that medication can you rate your pain for me what what's that pain level get to\n[patient] it goes down to about a four\n[doctor] okay so it does help take the edge off of that pain and and you're able to kinda move around a little bit then\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay so the remodel tell me a little bit about that my wife and i were working on our remodel and we went they just built the brand-new lowe's here in town have you guys

there we got some pain we we got went and got some samples and then hey while we were there we ended up deciding to put down a bunch of flooring too so i really recommend you guys if you get a chance go over there and take a look at their sales and and see if you ca n't finish your remodeled project\n[patient] that sounds great i'll have to take a look at the flooring as well\n[doctor] that sounds good so now just out of curiosity are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in in your arm or hand\n[patient] i did when i initially hurt it but i'm not no longer having any numbness or tingling\n[doctor] okay so a little bit about my physical exam i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you today now your vitals look good but specifically on your right shoulder exam you do have limited active and passive range of motion and there is tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus now there is no tenderness at your sternoclavicular joint and you do have good strong bilateral hand grips and on your neurovascular exam of your right arm you do have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds and you do have equal and bilateral response to sensation and touch which is good now taking a look at your x-ray that we did when you came in today good news is that right shoulder x-ray reveals no fracture or bony abnormality mkay so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now i your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy i think that you've injured the tendons of the muscles that make up the shoulder so that i think that's that's why you are having the that shoulder pain i do wan na order an mri of that right shoulder just to make sure that nothing else is going on now i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy and that's gon na be about six to eight weeks now my patients are very successful with their pt and let's see how you do before we make the decision that we would do additional treatment such as a steroid injection to that shoulder i do want you to continue to take an nsaid if you can tolerate tylenol i want you to go ahead and take tylenol for that pain do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan\n[patient] no i think it sounds good ca n't wait to to get some relief\n[doctor] okay so i know we ordered it for six to eight weeks but i wan na see you again in two weeks
