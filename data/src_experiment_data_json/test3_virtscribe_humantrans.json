            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up for diabetes management, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMaria Martin is a 75-year-old female who presents today for follow-up for diabetes.\n\nThe patient\u2019s blood glucose levels are poorly controlled and her most recent hemoglobin A1C is 9.9%. She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.\n\nShe confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.\n\nThe patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.\n\nMs. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.\n\nShe is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.\n\nThe patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nType 2 diabetes mellitus.\nHypertension.\nHyperlipidemia.\nPeripheral vascular disease with neuropathy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nCurrent tobacco smoker.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nMetoprolol 50 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.\nLisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.\nAmlodipine 10 mg tablet. Take 1 tablet daily.\nAtorvastatin tablet.\nMetformin.\nGlimepiride 4mg tablet. Take 2 tablets by oral route 2 times per day.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure 140/60.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\nNo rasping, wheezing.\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal heart rate and regular rhythm. Carotids and pulses are normal. S1 and S2 are crisp. No murmurs.\n\nGastrointestinal\nNo nausea or vomiting.\n\nExtremities\nBilateral Diabetic Foot Exam: No edema with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. No skin breakdown. Thickened nails.\nSensory Examination: Mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes bilaterally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nHemoglobin A1C 9.9%.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\u2022 Hypertension.\n\u2022 Hyperlipidemia.\n\u2022 Peripheral vascular disease.\n\nPLAN\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\nIncrease glimepiride to 4 mg tablets two times per day. I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I don\u2019t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.\n\nPeripheral vascular disease\nI counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.\n\nHypertension\nBlood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home. The patient will continue with amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nI will continue with atorvastatin as previously prescribed. If patient were to improve her diet, this would likely be beneficial as well.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFinish current prescription of glimepiride 2 mg, 2 tablets 2 times per day. Refill will be 4 mg tablet, 1 tablet 2 times per day. Reduce carbohydrate intake overall to improve glycemia. Call the office with questions or any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.\n",

He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems \"dull\". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given \"nerve pain medicine\u201d but has not been taking it.\n\nHe currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes.

His symptom presentation and exam findings today suggest this is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or, potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.\n\nPLAN\n\nDiagnosis discussed with patient, I explained that the nerves in his wrists are aggravated by the past trauma causing the pain and tingling. Further testing is indicated to measure the responsiveness of the nerves to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We will plan for a follow-up visit after the EMG testing is performed. If still symptomatic, we can consider a referral to our Hand Clinic possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery. We could also refer to an orthopedist for the same treatment.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow-up after EMG testing.",

feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ?\n[patient] no , not really .\n[doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?\n[patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .\n[doctor] okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?\n[patient] on the way , it is now i think about a year .\n[doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?\n[patient] i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .\n[doctor] are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?\n[patient] sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .\n[doctor] okay . what things bother you ?\n[patient] spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .\n[doctor] we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?\n[patient] yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .\n[doctor] okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?\n[patient] i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .\n[doctor] what do you do for work ?\n[patient] i'm a paralegal .\n[doctor] okay . and any family history of gi issues ?\n[patient] um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .\n[doctor] on your mom or dad's side ?\n[patient] mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .\n[doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?\n[patient] i think maybe when i was younger .\n[doctor] but not in the last 10 years ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?\n[patient] um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .\n[doctor] okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?\n[patient] i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .\n[doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .\n[patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .\n[doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .\n[patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .\n[doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .\n[patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .\n[doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .\n[patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?\n[doctor] yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?\n[patient] that sounds good .\n[doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .\n[doctor] please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .",
            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAcid reflux.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMichelle King is a 35 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux. She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.\n\nThe patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.\n\nMs. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nAnxiety.\n\nSurgical\nSurgery as an infant for \u201ctwisted intestines.\u201d\n\nProcedures\nPossible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nWorks as a paralegal.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nMaternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nOmeprazole 40 mg twice daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nSeasonal environmental allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022\u202fConstitutional Symptoms:\u202f Positive for loss of appetite.\n\u2022\u202fGastrointestinal:\u202fNegative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.\n\u2022\u202fPsychiatric:\u202f Positive for stress and anxiety.\n\u2022\u202fAllergic/Immunologic:\u202f Positive for seasonal allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\nThere is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nThe patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.\n\n\u2022 GERD\n\u2022 Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.\n\nPLAN\n\n\u2022 I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.\n\u2022 I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.\n\u2022 I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.\n\u2022 If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.\n\u2022 The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.\n\u2022 She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n\u2022 Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.\n\u2022 Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.\n\u2022 Schedule EGD.\n\u2022 Call with any changes or problems.\n\u2022 Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD.",

            "src": "[doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05/07/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06/29/2021 , and was discharged on 07/02/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ?\n[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?\n[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?\n[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?\n[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .\n[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , \" no , \" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .\n[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .\n[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?\n[doctor] typically , it does n't .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .\n[patient] yeah , that's what they said .\n[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...\n[patient] hm .\n[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?\n[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .\n[doctor] mm-hmm .\n[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .\n[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .\n[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .\n[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?\n[patient] yes , i am .\n[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?\n[patient] nope .\n[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?\n[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .\n[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?\n[patient] sure , i can do that .\n[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .\n[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .\n[doctor] yeah .\n[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .\n[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .\n[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?\n[doctor] yes .\n[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .\n[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?\n[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .\n[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?\n[patient] i am unvaccinated .\n[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?\n[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .\n[doctor] correct , we do n't .\n[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as \" vaccine injury \" .\n[doctor] right .\n[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .\n[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .\n[patient] all of them ?\n[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?\n[patient] no , i do n't .\n[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .\n[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .\n[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .\n[patient] mm-hmm .\n[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .\n[patient] i understand .\n[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .\n[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .\n[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?\n[patient] will do .\n[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?\n[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .\n[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .\n[patient] thanks , you too .\n[doctor] next line heading will be \" acute to chronic constipation \" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis .\n[doctor] i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be \" quadriplegia \" . um , next line and heading will be \" covid vaccine status \" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good discussion , and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid . however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .",

To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.\n\nToday, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.\n\nThe patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects.

            "src": "[doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?\n[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .\n[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\n[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?\n[patient] yeah , that sounds good .\n[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .\n[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] we automatically thought appendix .\n[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .\n[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .\n[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?\n[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .\n[doctor] wow . okay .\n[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .\n[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?\n[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .\n[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?\n[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .\n[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .\n[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .\n[doctor] mhm . okay .\n[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .\n[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?\n[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .\n[doctor] got you . okay .\n[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .\n[doctor] hmm . okay .\n[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .\n[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?\n[patient_guest] only pepcid .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .\n[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?\n[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .\n[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?\n[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .\n[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?\n[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .\n[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?\n[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .\n[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .\n[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .\n[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .\n[patient_guest] you're welcome .\n[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?\n[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .\n[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .\n[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , \" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . \" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .\n[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?\n[patient_guest] correct . yep .\n[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .\n[patient_guest] yes .\n[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?\n[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .\n[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?\n[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .\n[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?\n[patient] no , not that i've noticed .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .\n[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .\n[patient_guest] okay .\n[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .\n[patient_guest] okay . thank you .\n[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .\n[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .\n[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?\n[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .\n[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .\n[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .\n[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .\n[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .\n[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .\n[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .\n[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .\n[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .\n[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .\n[patient_guest] you too .\n[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?\n[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?\n[doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .\n[patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .\n[doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-\n[patient] he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .\n[doctor] not because of it . okay .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] i see what you're saying .\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] got it . cool . i'm gon na stop-",
            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nEvaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nNext patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.\n\nThe father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had \"a lot of infections\". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.\n\nPrior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.\n\nWhen the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.\n\nThe patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPaternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.\nPaternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.\n\nNo family history of polycystic kidney disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nPepcid 40 mg once daily.\nClaritin as needed for allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nWell-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.\n\nNeurological\nAlert.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAbdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.\nCT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.\nCMP, 03/22/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Renal hypoplasia.\nAshley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m\u00b2, and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.\n\nPLAN\n\nYearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.\n\nThe patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nSchedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician.",
