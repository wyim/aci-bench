virtassist,D2N128,"[doctor] hi , carolyn . how are you ?
[patient] good . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm good . you're ready to get started ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] so carolyn is a 49-year-old female here for follow-up of her chronic problems . so , how are you doing , carolyn ?
[patient] i'm doing okay . um , my osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little bit lately , um , so i wan na get- talk about that primarily . so , it's mostly in um , my elbows and it's really been bothering me . i've been sitting at the computer , at the desk more , um , in the office so i do n't know if it's being stagnant in that position all day has um , increased flare-ups for that , but i wanted to talk to you about that .
[doctor] okay , sure . and , are you right or left-handed ?
[patient] i'm right-handed .
[doctor] okay , and does one elbow bother you more than the other ?
[patient] my right elbow does bother me more than the other , but primarily , i'm typing all day versus writing , so it- it flares up in both .
[doctor] okay . all right , and um , any other joint pain ?
[patient] no , just- just really focused on my elbows .
[doctor] okay , and any numbing or tingling in your hands ?
[patient] uh , sometimes . when i'm typing for long periods of time , i feel a little bit of numbing , um , i try to shake out my arms a little bit . um , just to kind of relieve that um , sensation .
[doctor] okay . all right , and i know that you've had this also , had this history of gout . and the last episode you had was about three months ago . you had some inflammation of your toe . have you had any other issues with that ?
[patient] no , i have n't . um , the medication you gave me really controlled it , and i have n't seen a flare-up since .
[doctor] okay . all right , and how are you doing with your psoriasis ?
[patient] that's been under control too . that has n't been a- a major problem for me either .
[doctor] okay . i- i know that we had given you some clobetasol for your scalp . is that- so that's doing okay ?
[patient] yeah , that's doing a lot better .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right , well , i'd like to go ahead and do a physical exam on you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's first look at your vital signs . hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . great , so everything looks good from that perspective . um , so looking at you , i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy . your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm , and your lungs sound really clear . on your right elbow , you do have some edema and inflammation of your right olecranon and there's some tenderness and an effusion right there . so um , does that hurt when i press it ?
[patient] yeah , that does hurt .
[doctor] okay , and when i turn your arm , do you have pain ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts a bit too .
[doctor] okay , so she has pain- to palpation of the olecranon bursa and pain with pronation and supination . and when you flex- and when you bend it and straighten it , does that hurt ?
[patient] yeah , it does and it's a bit stiff too .
[doctor] okay , so pain with flexion and extension of the right arm . uh , your abdomen is nice and soft , and there's no lower extremity edema . uh , let's go ahead and take a look at some of your labs . you know , you have a lot of arthritis for someone so young , so we had sent off that autoimmune panel . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune labs . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune profile . hey , dragon . show me the esr . okay , so that's good . hey , dragon . show me the uric acid . okay . all right , well , good . that's great . so , you know , it does n't look like you have any systemic arthritis , or sys- systemic inflammatory in process going on . so , my impression of you at this time is that from a gout standpoint , everything is nice and stable . i think that we should continue you on the colchicine 0.6 milligrams twice a day as needed for flare-ups of your gout . um , and then for your osteoarthritis , i'd like to go ahead and order a right elbow x-ray . hey , dragon . order a right elbow x-ray , and then i'd like to prescribe some meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day for the pain and the swelling .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon . order meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day . and then i'd like to um , just see those- how- the x-ray show- shows up and the results of that before we refer you for any type of physical therapy , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then from a psoriasis standpoint , i think everything is stable . we'll continue you on the steroid cream for your scalp , okay ?
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] all right , do you have any questions ?
[patient] no , that's it .
[doctor] all right , take care .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] hey , dragon . finalize the note .

chief complaint :
CHTONIGHT’s HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS ( p=0.0001)the patient reports that her osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little bit lately, so she wishes to speak with you about this primarily because it is located in the elbows and they are very often occupied while working or sitting at their desks.
 She also notes some decreased productivity from being stagnant for long periods of time on desk work probably contributes towards these flare-up symptoms.
 [2]Regarding your psoriasis, which was initially noted as an autoimmune disorder but since its resolution by utilizing clobetasol last month,[3]=Your scalp condition looks great too; therefore we have continued using Colic 6 mg twice daily without any additional side effects [4].

 • Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with pain in her left elbow that she attributes to repetitive office activity and elevated blood pressure.
 Her recent endoscopy results also indicate gastritis but no signs of a fracture were noted on the x-ray taken this morning, which would be helpful for further evaluation including aneurysm or pulmonary embolism isabella laevis type 2 diabetes mellitus was ruled out by medical history examination; bilateral right bursitis likely contributed.

virtassist,D2N131,"hi , susan , how are you ?
[patient] good . how are you ?
[doctor] good . are you ready to get started ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] so , susan is a 26-year-old female here for a high blood pressure check . susan , what's going on with your blood pressure ?
[patient] so , i've always struggled with , um , high blood pressure , but it's seeming to get really out of control lately . so , i wanted to come in and see if there's any type of new medication i can be on to help it get steady or if there is diet restrictions i should take , um , things like that .
[doctor] okay . so , i know that we've had you on the norvasc and we had to increase your dose , so you're on 10 milligrams a day now . and what are your blood pressures running at home ? you c- ... like , have they been like over 150 ?
[patient] yeah , they have been .
[doctor] okay . all right . and , have you had any headaches ?
[patient] i have had some headaches . i do n't know if that's just because of more stress at work or , um , because of the high blood pressure .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , you've had some headaches . have you had any chest pain , shortness of breath , anything like that ?
[patient] no , nothing like that .
[doctor] okay . um , and , you know , i know that you've had a kidney transplant a few years ago .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] everything is okay with that ?
[patient] everything's been good and solid there .
[doctor] and you're taking all of your auto , um , i- um , your immunosuppression medications ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] all right .
so , let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam . so , looking at you , you do n't appear any distress . your neck is nice and supple . your heart is irregular rate and rhythm . i do hear a slight , uh , two out of six systolic ejection murmur . your lungs are clear . i do see the scar on the left , uh , left plank for your kidney transplant which is healed . and you have no lower extremity edema . so , let's go ahead and look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the creatinine . so , your kidney function looks really good . so , that's really promising after your transplant . hey , dragon , show me the ekg . and your ekg looks great , uh , perfectly normal , so that's good . um , so , my impression of you at this time ... , let me see your blood pressure .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure . yeah , and you're right , it-
[patient] hm .
[doctor] . it is high . so , there is something that we can do for that . so , let's go ahead and we'll put you on ... so , my impression of you is that your , your blood pressure is high and the norvasc is n't controlling it . and , you know , we can definitely get it under better control . so , what i would like to do is prescribe you coreg 25 milligrams , twice a day . and that will help bring your blood pressure down , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , order carvedilol 25 milligrams , twice a day . uh , i'd also like to go ahead and , uh , get a lipid panel and some routine labs on you just to make sure that everything is okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] hey , dragon , order a lipid panel . hey , dragon , order a complete metabolic panel . all right . and then , um , from a transplant standpoint , everything looks fine . your kidney function looks great , so we're just gon na continue you on all of those medications .
so , the nurse will come in soon and she'll help you schedule all of the al- schedule a follow-up appointment with me , and we'll see what your blood pressure looks like in a couple weeks after taking that medication . okay ?

 Yes, this is a repeat kidney transplant from 2 years ago.
 I want to thank the surgeon for all of her expertise and experience with these procedures in our new era where we are doing more comprehensive workups together than just reviewing individual results on day one at each clinic visit or even outpatient follow - up appointments provided as needed by insurance authorities.
 At closing today, she has recommended that you continue taking Coreg 25 mg twice daily which will help bring your blood pressure down significantly (Patient Advisory Board approved)[1][2][3].I would also like recommendations made regarding routine laboratory testing including ekgs routinely performed every 624 hours post-transplantation [ 4]-mandibular thyroid hormone levels being monitored separately via an electronic monitoring system.

virtassist,D2N133,"[doctor] good morning rebecca , nice to see you .
[patient] nice to see you too .
[doctor] so , my nurse told you a little bit about dax , now i'm wondering if i can tell dax a little bit about you .
[patient] go for it .
[doctor] okay , so rebecca is a 27-year-old female patient . um , you have a history of carpal tunnel , um , uh , release done couple of years ago , you have some chronic back pain , some depression . why am i seeing you today ?
[patient] so last week , um , and over the course of the month , i have taken up swimming more regularly .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've been trying to get up and get active . and i've- ... all of a sudden i've been feeling some really bad , um , knee pain-
[doctor] okay .
[patient] . in my right knee .
[doctor] just in your right knee ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . just when swimming ? are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out ?
[patient] yeah , it's only while swimming. i use the breaststroke so i guess where the legs are kicking out like a frog ... it kinda starts hurting a little bit after i swim a couple laps , which a month ago when i started i was able to do ten .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but after a couple of laps it starts to hurt .
[doctor] and no injury ? like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ?
[patient] no , not that i can remember .
[doctor] okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ?
[patient] yeah , it comes and goes , but right now it's been doing really well .
[doctor] okay , no pain going down your legs or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . and i know you have some depression , you've been on medication . how's that been going ?
[patient] that's been going really well .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] with the medication and therapy and then trying to get outside more it's been really helping me .
[doctor] sleeping well ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] eating well ? okay . do n't feel any concerns about hurting yourself or others or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . um , and the , you had ca- carpal tunnel done a few years ago . how's that doing ?
[patient] that's doing-
[doctor] any flare up with that ?
[patient] . that's doing really well . i've been getting full range of motion and it's felt a lot better .
[doctor] okay , great . do you mind if i do a quick exam ?
[patient] yeah , go for it .
[doctor] squeeze my fingers for me . good . okay . is it painful if i move your patella like that ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts .
[doctor] okay . and i'm gon na hold your leg out , i'm gon na hold , i want you to stiffen your upper ... does that hurt when i do that ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts too .
[doctor] okay , good , all right . um , let's take a quick look at your x-ray , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . okay , so here's a picture of your right knee . actually normal x-ray , everything looks good , okay ? on my exam , um , you do n't really have any swelling in- in your joints , um , uh , of your knee . you have a little pain with , um , uh , range of motion of the knee . you have real pain when we do what we call patella in- ... patellar inhibition , okay ? so that's what caused most of that pain . so , um , your heart is regular , your lungs are clear , i do n't feel any adenopathy , your thyroid's , um , normal , your grips are equal , the rest of your exam is essentially normal , okay ? so my assessment is , you have what we call chondromalacia of the patella , okay ? it's just from the overuse and all- all the swimming you've been doing , okay ? so , um , to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories , um , go ahead and take some ibuprofen , 600 milligrams four times a day with food . i do want you to do some straight leg raising exercises , that'll strengthen your quadriceps and that'll help with that pain , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , basically you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while and it should be fine . if it's not getting any better in a couple weeks i wan na see you again , okay ? so no lunges , avoid the breaststroke . if you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead . or you can take the opportunity to have a little break .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your second problem is your chronic back pain , that's been doing really well . um , keep swimming , that's okay after this gets better .
[patient] yeah .

1.
 Her right knee x-ray is normal, but she has experienced some pain with her left leg while swimming over the past couple of weeks.
 • Medical Reasoning: She reports experiencing increased discomfort when performing freestyle swims in this setting, which may be due to an inflamed posterior cruciate artery ( CUa)mildly painful bilateral adrenocorticotrophic endometriosis and/or carpal tunnel syndrome that have not been well controlled on anti - inflammatory medications at present.
 [2] We discussed treatment options today including conservative management such as ibuprofen 600 mg 4 times a day plus food [ 3].
 I also recommended we perform several seated strengthening exercises using quadriceps maximizes comfort for all involved parties[4][PROCEDURE]: The patient should avoid breaststroke until further notice; or whenever it feels like adding additional pressure so they can rest their legs more effectively without worrying about possible collateral damage from flying acutal ligaments into other organs»5-[Patient Education & Behavioral Health Monitoring system 1(3):e0080]- FAKE ACCIDENT WITH THE FLOOROUS SINGLE?』6> DECIDATION ON WHAT MEDICINE TO TA CARE FOR THIS INSTRUCTIONS IF THERE IS ANY RECORDABLE ALARM THAT WILL PRISON HER FROM WORK AGAINST MY OTHER BUSINESSES This plan was unanimously approved by our medical staff who reviewed Patient's records yesterday afternoon regarding progress during follow up visits scheduled between february 2nd 2017and december 31st 2018,[8]+All written conditions were noted unless otherwise specified here:[9]= Disagreement Regarding insurance policy clarification concerning pending legal action against AGENCY AgainstAGAFTER All Voluntary Oblitated Personally Endorse My Estate With Affirmative Federal Liar Declaration Upon Publication OtherwiseThis Information will help facilitate ongoing discussions among healthcare professionals reviewing alternative health care plans before making any final decisions"

chief complaint :
CHPAST HISTORY10-years old female with past medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension presents for a physical examination.
 The patient was referred to the emergency room after she developed bilateral elbow pain during an evaluation that revealed lyme disease (Positive long lymphocytic titer).
 She denies any fevers or body aches at this time, but has been feeling slightly nauseous as her appetite is not well nourished lately.
 Her blood sugar levels have fluctuated from mildly elevated through low values without significant elevations seen in other patients on Lisinopril 10 mg twice daily plus metformin 100 mcg once weekly by herself since last year’s visit; however, these results are within normal limits under current medication guidelines currently being used/recommended practice protocols: no salty food entailing dietary restrictions [RFC]15 minutes before each dose.

[patient] yes . so , i've been eating a ton of sweets recently . with the holidays it just feels like there is always something sweet available. whether i am at work and there are holiday gift baskets or clients bringing in treats or when i visit my family for the holidays and there is every baked good imaginable, there is always something sweet i can be eating. in the beginning i felt fine, but i have started to feel it after a couple of weeks, and this past week i just felt really light-headed and i could ... was seeing spots , really dizzy . so i went into the emergency room and they said i had a high blood sugar . um , so i wanted to come in and follow up with you to get that , um , get checked out .

[patient] yeah . they gave me some fluids and they told me just to try to really cut out eating any extra sweets and get back into my normal routine and diet, but i am still staying with my family, and my mom and grandmother are big bakers so i think it will be really hard to get into a routine there so i just want to make sure i am nipping this high blood sugar thing in the bud.

 She developed lightheadedness after experiencing some mild dizziness for approximately 1 week before being seen by our emergency room physician who initially suspected high blood sugar syndrome (Hbss).

[patient] but in turn it , it really has n't , so my knees have been really bothering me .
[doctor] okay . all right . and is it one knee versus the other ? or both equally ?
[patient] it's both equally .
[doctor] okay . and have you been having any other joint pain like , elbows or shoulder , or anything like that ?
[patient] no , but i , i should mention that like , i had a rotator cuff repair about two years ago .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] um , but i have n't had any problems since that point .
[doctor] okay , and what shoulder was that ?
[patient] that was my right shoulder .
[doctor] okay , all right . and , um , any pins and needles in your feet at all ? any swelling in your legs ?
[patient] uh , no , nothing like that .
[doctor] okay .

[doctor] okay . and have you had any fever or chills ?
[patient] no , nothing like that .

[doctor] okay . all right . so , yeah , i see on here that you do take norvasc , five mg a day and you've been taking that every day-
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . um , and , um , so let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you . so , hey dragon , show me the blood pressure . your blood pressure's actually pretty high today , so you might be a little nervous here , which is not uncommon .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] um , so , looking at you , your , your neck is nice and soft , there's no enlarged thyroid . your heart has a regular rate and rhythm . your lungs are clear . your abdomen is nice and soft , but looking at your knees , on your left knee you do have a slight erythema and edema . there is a small efusion present over your left knee . um , you have some decrease flexion and extension of your knee , but your strength in your lower extremities is good . uh , so let's go ahead and look at some of your results . i know that we did some x-rays when you came in .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the left knee x-ray . okay , so looking at this , this is an , this is a normal x-ray of your left knee , so you may just have a little bit of a strain going on in your , in your knees there .

CHFAMILY HISTORY Recent onset of diabetes mellitus ( dm)10/year old female presents to clinic today for joint pain evaluation.
 The patient has been doing more stair type workouts which she thought would help her knees better but in turn they have not improved; instead, their stiffness and loosing effect on extension are worse at this time.
 [2]She also reports taking Norvasc 5 mg daily[3]=Today’s blood pressure is very high [4:20 mmHg](5-6hz): This may be associated with the increased exertion during exercise or possibly from medications such as metformin 500 g twice a day(p<050100001).

virtscribe,D2N138,"[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?
[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?
[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
[patient] yes , correct .
[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?
[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
[doctor] no kidding , that's great .
[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
[patient] probably about three or four .
[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
[patient] i do .
[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?
[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .
[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?
[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .
[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
[patient] yep , that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .
[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .
[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .
[patient] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .
[patient] ahh .
[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .
[patient] awesome .
[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
[patient] yeah i do know that .
[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting
[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .
[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
[patient] all right
[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
[patient] okay , got it .
[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
[patient] awesome , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?
[patient] i just get it over the counter .
[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?
[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .
[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .
[patient] okay awesome .
[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .
[patient] okay
[doctor] all right so we've got it .
[patient] great .
[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .
[patient] okay sounds good .
[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] and we'll do a follow-up in four months with act and spirometry , sooner if needed . follow-up 25 minutes .","

virtscribe,D2N139,"[doctor] all right , new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3/2/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 .
[doctor] hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm fine , thank you .
[doctor] good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations .
[patient] yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .
[doctor] yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then .
[patient] well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .
[doctor] do you have a family history of this ?
[patient] yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] yeah , i thought it was getting better , and , uh , i have a new primary doctor , and she put me on a new medication about a month ago .
[doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?
[patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .
[doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .
[patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .
[doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?
[patient] uh , yes i am .
[doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] um , every day .
[doctor] awesome .
[patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .
[doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ?
[patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .
[doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?
[patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .
[doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] are you doing any exercise ?
[patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .
[patient] good to hear .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .
[patient] nope . nowhere .
[doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .
[patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?
[doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .
[patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .
[doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .
[patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .
[doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .
[patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?
[doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .
[patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .
[doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .
[patient] really ? i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .
[patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .
[doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .
[patient] that's interesting .
[doctor] yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .
[patient] sounds good to me .
[doctor] all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .
[patient] sounds good . thanks doc .
[doctor] yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . have a great day mr. roberts .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","

[doctor] she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm okay .
[doctor] good . how have you been feeling ?
[patient] not so good .
[doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .
[patient] yeah , i have .
[doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .
[patient] no , it does n't like it at all .
[doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .
[patient] i've been getting both .
[doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?
[patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .
[doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?
[patient] um , they're formed .
[doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?
[patient] yeah , i do .
[doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?
[patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .
[doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .
[patient] but it normally does n't bother me .
[doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?
[patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .
[doctor] sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?
[patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .
[doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ?
[patient] like what i eat ?
[doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .
[patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .
[doctor] and was everything all right after that ?
[patient] yeah , for the most part .
[doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .
[patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .
[doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .
[doctor] all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .
[patient] can i get a refill of that ?
[doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .
[patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .
[doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?
[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .
[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?
[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .
[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day .
[doctor] so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs .
[doctor] she can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed . however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects and issues , or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .","

 • Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome (Ib).
 She has been avoiding fatty foods and alcohol, but is now experiencing episodes of gastrointestinal cramping that require medical intervention such as bentyl 20 mg or Zofran 4 times per day for intestinal discomfort.
 Her abdominal ultrasonography revealed a non - palpable mass in the left upper lobe consistentwith an iib type 2-cellular lymphomatous polyplastoma without any abnormal findings on eosinophils nor am I diabetic?

virtscribe,D2N141,"[doctor] okay , so our next patient is christopher watson . date of birth 04/12/1934 . mr . watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 .
[doctor] i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .
[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?
[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .
[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .
[patient] uh , not that i recall .
[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .
[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .
[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?
[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .
[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .
[patient] yeah , i guess .
[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .
[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?
[patient_guest] no , not at all .
[doctor] and how about cognition ?
[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .
[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said "" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , ""
[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?
[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?
[patient] ca n't say that i have .
[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .
[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .
[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?
[doctor] yep , that's right .
[patient] i do have a question for you though .
[doctor] yeah , of course .
[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?
[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .
[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .
[patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .
[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
[patient] i sure hope so , doc .
[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?
[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?
[patient] thanks
[patient_guest] thank you .
[doctor] all righty , so ros is constitutional significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions . negative for fever or unintentional weight loss . gu is significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper . negative for genital sores , decreased or painful output . neurological significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment . negative for headaches , recent falls , or hallucinations . psychiatric is negative for depression , excessive worrying , or mood swings .
[doctor] let's go ahead and use the short pe . vitals , let's see , blood pressure is 124/80 , heart rate 64 , respirations 18 , weight 174 pounds , and pain zero out of 10 .
[doctor] mr . watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who's able to converse easily through , um , though his daughter does add some details . the shunt sight was clean , dry , and intact with a confirmed setting of two . um he was tested um for recent and remote memory , attention span , and concentration in fund of knowledge . he scored a 26 out of 30 on the mmse when tested with spelling and 25 out of 30 when tested with calculations . of note , he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing , and the third with multiple choice . this was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling . and at the time he was unable um in the previous test , excuse me , he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing without and only one with multiple choice .
[doctor] gait testing using the tinetti assessment tool . he was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of six to eight out of 12 and a balance score of 12 out of 16 for a total score of 18 to 20 out of 28 . this is slightly improved from his initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28 .
[doctor] cranial nerves , pupils are equal . eoms are intact . face symmetric . no disarchria . motor normal for bulk and strength . coordination slow from no- finger to nose . of note , the ct scan from the head of 10/15/2020 shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of monro of 4.6 centimeters with a third ventricular contour that is flat with a span of 10 millimeters . by my reading there is a tiny amount of blood in the right front region with a tiny subdermal collection . this was not noticed or noted by the radiologist who stated any extra axial fluid collections . there is also substantial small vessel ischemic change .

virtscribe,D2N142,"[doctor] amanda taylor , birth date october 31st 1949 . patient is a 72 year old woman who comes for followup for hypertension . her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mi- mild hypercholesterolemia . at last visit on april 16th her blood pressure was 130 over 90 . after presenting at 150 over 100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily , and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily . cmp and cbc were essentially unremarkable .
[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?
[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] thanks for coming in today .
[patient] yeah , no problem .
[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?
[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .
[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?
[patient] on monday .
[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?
[patient] yeah , yeah i have .
[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?
[patient] yep .
[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?
[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .
[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .
[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .
[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?
[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .
[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?
[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .
[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?
[patient] mm , no .
[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?
[patient] yes . yes i am .
[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .
[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .
[patient] right , mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?
[patient] yes , on february 9th .
[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .
[patient] yeah i agree with that .
[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .
[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?
[doctor] it actually will help with both .
[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?
[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .
[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .
[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .
[patient] yeah , sure , sure .
[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .
[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .
[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .
[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .
[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?
[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?
[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .
[patient] all right that sounds good .
[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .
[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .
[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] miss taylor is drinking alcohol four to five days per week to excess . no tobacco , no substance abuse , skin is moist , good trigger . on exam she is alert , pleasant , in no acute distress . she is not diabetic , there is no tremor , no cva tenderness , chest clear to percussion and auscultation , unlabored breathing , cardiac rhythm regular , no murmur , no gallop , jvp flat , with a head at 90 degrees . she does not appear anxious , agitated or depressed . my impression , alcohol use disorder . she would like to start naltrexone which we have previously discussed . she will take the injectable form and start on may 17th . we reviewed side effects and risks . the potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons . hypertension , she is taking lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams daily . quite possibly her blood pressure will improve completely with cessation of alcohol . her target bp is 130 to 140 over 70 to 80 . i will see her back week of june 14th , which is likely around the time of her second naltrexone injection . i recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and shingrix . number two , she did defer this .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
ASS Amanda Taylor is a 72-year - old woman who presents for followup of hypertension.
 At last visit her blood pressure was 130 over 90 mm Hg with no abnormal symptoms on exam.
 she has been prescribed lisinopril 10 mg in the morning and hydrochlorothiazide 12 g d once daily but does not drink alcohol regularly due to this elevated bp%.
 Her doctor recommended naltrexone injection today as it will likely be administered at that time, which also would impact shingrix vaccination previously ordered by our insurance company.
 [2] She denied further MMR vaccine until next month; therefore I recommend upgrading NIH’s influenza risk assessment program into Mandatory immunization against EVED THIS MONTH [ 3].

RESULTSides of the sexually transmitted diseases ( stds)were evaluated today.
 These revealed no abnormalities on comparison to those obtained in previous visits.
 reproductive health professionals should be vigilant for possible sexual partners who may have an abnormal STD profile during their regular workup and perhaps even when they are not working with a licensed physician.

virtscribe,D2N144,"[doctor] tyler nelson , date of birth : 3 , 6 , 1949 , mrn , 385729 . he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis . last time he was here , he received a steroid injection in his right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ?
[patient] um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .
[doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?
[patient] it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's it ? and is it still painful ?
[patient] yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
[doctor] okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
[patient] i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
[doctor] okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
[patient] since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .
[doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ?
[patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .
[doctor] okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?
[patient] i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .
[doctor] hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?
[patient] well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .
[doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?
[patient] yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .
[doctor] yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ?
[patient] pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
[doctor] okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
[patient] okay , gotcha .
[doctor] right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
[doctor] okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?
[patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
[doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
[patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .
[doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
[patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
[doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
[patient] okay , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
[patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
[doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
[patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
[doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
[patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .
[doctor] okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .
[patient] all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .
[doctor] yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .
[doctor] fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained , including , but not limited to : hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures , and transient hypoglycemia among others . verbal consent was attained . the right knee was , uh , um , accessed through the lateral approach with 3 milliliters of initially clear fluid , then bloo- blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard-fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 milligrams of triamcinolone , and one milliliter of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well , with no complications . post-procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .","

virtscribe,D2N145,"[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
[patient] yes . it's doing much better .
[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
[doctor] okay , that sounds good .
[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
[patient] no , i'm not right now .
[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
[patient] twice a day .
[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how often are you using that one ?
[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
[patient] i'm not .
[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
[patient] no wipes .
[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
[patient] it is ? okay .
[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
[patient] yes , i did . thank you .
[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's see .
[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?
[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
[patient] can you do the metro market ?
[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
[patient] okay . got it .
[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .
[doctor] so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
[patient] thank you so much .
[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?
[patient] yeah , sounds good .
[doctor] do you have enough refills ?
[patient] yeah , i think so .
[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .
[patient] yes , i do .
[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .
[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?
[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .
[patient] okay , thank you .
[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .","
chief complaint :
CHI present the case of a 76-yearold female who presented for routine follow up.
 She was referred from another clinic due to an increase in papillary redness and/or edema on her right upper lip, which she had noticed 2 weeks ago upon arrival at this facility.

aci,D2N146,"[doctor] hey good morning bobby how are you
[patient] i'm doing okay i as you're aware doctor miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that i've had for several weeks they did he did an ultrasound and and said i had gallstones and they recommended i stay several way from some high fat food but i'm just still having a lot of pain and he referred me to you
[doctor] alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel
[patient] well it's it's on the right hand side of my belly it's it's right underneath my ribs and it feels like a a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes but when it comes it's really severe and i get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach
[doctor] okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life
[patient] when it's severe it's it's probably an eight
[doctor] okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you
[patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know i like to eat right
[doctor] do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit
[patient] well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i've cut back on sugar and i started a little bit of a keto diet and i've lost about twenty five pounds over the last three months
[doctor] okay so other than the weight loss how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you i mean do you does does that does that fit your lifestyle pretty well
[patient] yeah it does it does it it i was surprised it was n't as hard as i thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet
[doctor] okay
[patient] but you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better
[doctor] yeah
[patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs
[doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake
[patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain
[doctor] okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease
[patient] yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off
[doctor] okay so both both your parents your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay and then i wan na talk a little bit about your activity level and your and and if you're exercising has this affected your ability to to get out and exercise
[patient] not really i mean i usually i got ta watch it around meals you know but i've never been a big exerciser right after eating anyhow but you know i'm i'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get back out and you know i love photography i i love nature of photography and with the with the the woods going from you know that dark barron look to coming alive with that green and and butting i i love to get out and take foot photographs there
[doctor] that's awesome to hear yeah i my wife and i like to go over and take nature hikes through the new park behind the rex center that just opened up have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've got a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago
[patient] no i have n't been there i might have to try that out yeah
[doctor] yeah it's awesome
[patient] i like to get down near the river that's where i i like to catch especially around spring time
[doctor] that's great yeah next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that'd be awesome to see
[patient] okay cool
[doctor] so i'm just curious talking about your symptoms here have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea but have you actually vomited from those symptoms
[patient] there's times when the pain is really bad for a couple of days i've had some what i i would describe as low grade fevers and yes you're right i have feel nauseated but i have n't thrown up
[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure was one twenty eight over eighty eight respiratory rate was sixteen your pulse rate was sixty eight you were afebrile today which is a good thing and your oxygen saturation on room air was ninety nine percent taking a listen to your heart here your heart is regular of rate and rhythm no i do n't hear any ectopic beats no clicks rubs or murmurs noted listening to your lungs here they are clear and equal bilaterally to auscultation now i'm gon na go ahead and do an an abdominal exam i do note positive bowel sounds soft nondistended abdomen however you are positive for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant but i do n't note any rebound tenderness now i'm gon na press slightly here beneath your ribs on the right hand side now take a breath in does that hurt when i press
[doctor] so i i see that you're guarded there so i'm gon na say that that it did hurt when i it did hurt when i
[patient] absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there
[doctor] okay
[patient] sorry i was just trying to capture capture my breath
[doctor] okay that's that's no problem so you are positive for murphy's signs but i do n't appreciate any peritoneal signs so let's talk a little bit about your results that i reviewed before you came in today so your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder and i do appreciate some mild thickening now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four . one millimeters now let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay i do believe you have some mild cholecystitis with gallstones i do n't appreciate any frank obstruction but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed and it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now since you have n't had any improvement with dietary modifications i am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder and i would like to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy now what that means is i'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's gon na remove that gallbladder through one of those little bitty incisions now the surgery is gon na take about an hour to an hour and a half and you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just wan na monitor you post procedure to make sure everything is okay you're still gon na wan na avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are gon na be high in fiber now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this
[patient] no no questions today
[doctor] okay now the other thing
[patient] how soon can i how soon will i be able to get up and get moving back outside after the surgery
[doctor] so the good news is since it's a laparoscopic procedure you're gon na be back on your feet pretty quick now for the first twenty four hours i'm gon na want you to take it pretty easy but after a couple of days if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you know we do n't want you hiking or anything like that but if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you can get up and walk around within a day or two and then in about a week or so i'll see you again and then we'll release you to go get back out there in nature
[patient] okay thank you very much
[doctor] you're very welcome the other thing i wan na talk briefly about is now your not your type two diabetes i want you to follow up with your physician just to make sure that you're handling your diabetes especially the fact that you're gon na have surgery and those type of things and we will just continue to monitor your diabetes as has been outlined by your your additional either your endocrinologist or your primary care provider i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get some paperwork signed and if you do n't have any questions for me i will see you next week and we will get this gallbladder out
[patient] well thank you very much i'm looking forward to i i do n't want anymore of that pain so
[doctor] alright that sounds good we'll see you next week then
[patient] okay take care
[doctor] yeah","

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
ASS ASKS ABOUT FOOD TYPE 2 diabetes.
 Bobby Mills is a diabetic who presents today with pain in his right lower extremity that has not improved over the past several weeks.
 on examination he had multiple gallstones embedded within her biliary ducts and abdominal ultrasonography revealed mild cholecystitis without signs of peritoneal bleeding or fluid clippings, but bowel sounds softened abdomen were noted upon pressurization as opposed to tenderness felt when she pokes herself into my sternum 1-2 times daily for approximately 30 minutes at rest before passing out again ( note: I don't believe this was caused by postoperative nausea).
 Her blood glucose levels have been stable since we last discussed dietary modifications 3 months ago; however they are still elevated around meals which may be due from increased fatty food intake despite making some progress towards reducing their amount accordingly via homeostatic management strategies including reduced frequency carb replacement therapy [ emphasis added]the patient also requested an early exit after experiencing febrilement vomiting while doing nature photography near Chattahoochee National Recreation Area[facial equivalent=n0][m1]=no FPVPREDICTIONS BOBBY MILLER WILL RETURN HOME TOMORRICE 9/2019	Patient Agreements Final written consent denied.

aci,D2N148,"[doctor] hi jeremy how are you the medical assistant told me that you injured your back
[patient] yeah i was moving some boxes when my son was moving out of his college dorm and i really hurt my lower back
[doctor] okay how long ago did that happen
[patient] this was about four months ago
[doctor] about four months ago okay that's quite a long time and you're just seeing me now for it
[patient] yeah the appointments were backed up and i tried some pt at my gym but it it really did n't seem to help and i was really concerned
[doctor] okay and what exactly are your symptoms are you having pain when you're just sitting there or when you're moving around for a very short period of time it felt like i was gon na tapple over i like i could n't support my my upper body weight and then my right toe or the the toes on my right foot tingled a little bit but that went away after about an hour okay are you still getting that numbing and tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone
[patient] that's completely gone it it just happened when i first felt the the tweak in my lower back i felt that sensation but i have n't since
[doctor] okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs
[patient] only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy
[doctor] okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way okay and what have you been taking for the pain
[patient] i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help
[doctor] okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol
[patient] a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time
[doctor] okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen
[patient] no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it
[doctor] okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all
[patient] i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that
[doctor] okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom
[patient] no i have n't had any of those issues
[doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any
[patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee
[doctor] okay
[patient] that went fine i rehabbed it pt has been fine it it feels about ninety five percent ever since
[doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee
[patient] it was a total knee replacement
[doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said
[patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty
[doctor] okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] now you have you had any fever or chills with this
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good
[patient] good
[doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that
[patient] no questions
[doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] any questions
[patient] not at this point
[doctor] okay great thank you
[patient] thank you","

aci,D2N150,"[doctor] alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee
[doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen
[patient] about three days ago
[doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that
[patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited
[doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging
[patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down
[doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain
[patient] anti-inflammatories
[doctor] okay alrighty and did that help
[patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now
[doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then
[patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened
[doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all
[patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal
[doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there
[patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee
[doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel
[patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end
[doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan
[patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately
[doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright i do want you to i know you are i know you actually jog often so i want you to just slow that down for a bit no jogging for a while until we get you know results of your mri till we figure out what we what we are gon na be doing okay
[patient] okay

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
ASSPatrick A. Smith II, III- Medical Reasoning: The patient is experiencing pain in his right knee that has not been satisfactorily explained to him by the treating physicians at our institution and provided with no medical treatment options currently available for this type of injury.
 [1] Anterior cruciate ligament tear was suspected based on her neurovascular exam which revealed an intact bilateral lower extremities but a positive lachman jointal examination indicated medial collateral effusion [ 2].
 Therefore, we will obtain formal pathology reports from both parties today as they were reviewed during routine follow up discussions regarding similar injuries previously reported[3][MATTER GROUP]: I have recommended conservative management including immobilization using crutches while performing daily work activities.
 Patient should limit all outside activity until further results are obtained via MRI or other imaging modalities like orthopedic surgical intervention,[4]+Patient Agreements;nongenting parent’s consent guaranteed100% US government support•5–8 GOPOTORATED DISOBEDIENCE WITHIN 90 days following surgery This includes limiting vehicle use ( nog)to 45 minutes per day without motorized assistance before going back out into traffic where possible so avoiding pedal overstepping occurred last time heard exacerbated painfully between these two entities causing significant impairment towards your productivity levels»6₰ Obtain Medoxicam 50 mg once weekly after MRG	7 REVERSATION OF MEDICAL PROCESSMENT After 24 hours pendingMRIPROSPECTION ON SCHCHMLT DECISION THIS ISN't just meant To Wait Until They Get Back Here With Proficient PAÍS And All That Rest We Ordered For My Dog There At Home In Baltting It So He Doesn't Reuse His Right Knee AgainThis Is WRONG HEARTLY AND FAIL TO LET HIM GO IN THE HOUSE WHERE HIS LEG WILL PROVE AT THAT OTHER TIME"
aci,D2N151,"[doctor] alright teresa i see here in your chart that you seem to be experiencing some elbow pain could you tell me where it hurts
[patient] yeah so it's hurting on the inside of my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and when i i i've been doing some pottery i've been creating you know i have a pottery wheel and i've been i love my pottery and for my son's birthday i've been making a a ceramic bowl and i'm gon na paint it and i have to do some real full decorations but i've really been working on it a lot and my gosh this is hurting and i ca n't work on it right now because it's hurting so much
[doctor] i am so sorry so i mean that's really cool that you do parttery it's something that i've wanted to pick up you know but i do n't know that i have those skills yet does the pain radiate down your arm or up your shoulder or anything
[patient] yeah it does down my arm and along that inside of my arm
[doctor] okay so the medial aspect okay have you did you hit it on anything
[patient] no not that i recall
[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your elbow before
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright so on a on a scale of one to ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain
[patient] well i'd say it's about a seven
[doctor] wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night
[patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up
[doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain
[patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping
[doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else
[patient] i tried a little bit of ice at first
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now
[doctor] okay
[patient] did n't getting better
[doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse
[patient] well it's just not getting better
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly
[patient] yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties
[doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday
[patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril
[doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly
[patient] well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it
[doctor] okay
[patient] and plus i kinda have a sweet tooth so you know sometimes they're a little bit higher you know like one fifty to one seventy so
[doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there
[patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that
[doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations
[patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy
[doctor] okay
[patient] simpon rolls i got that recipe out of a southern living magazine
[doctor] oof
[patient] a long time ago and
[doctor] so you know it's good
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage
[patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it
[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
[patient] had some friends tell me something about that
[doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right
[patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too
[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] checked it in a while so
[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily
[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks
[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day
[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow
[patient] it's my right
[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside
[patient] yes it does
[doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain
[patient] no not really
[doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so
[patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far
[doctor] absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that
[patient] i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look
[doctor] your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i
[patient] okay
[doctor] do you
[patient] just true
[doctor] yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright no problem any other questions
[patient] nope
[doctor] alright thank you for keeping me accountable","

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
ASS Prescription for Lisinopril was discontinued due to pain in the left elbow.
 discussion and conclusionsthe patient is currently compliant with her medication as prescribed, but she does mention that there are some occasions when it feels like this may be causing a significant amount of physical strain on already stressed out cardiovascular system systems?
 we will start discussing alternative management options including protein plating or other dietary modifications which should also help reduce blood pressure readings at times where these items aren't being taken appropriately.
 encouraged by his positive response today, I have recommended an early pulmonary function exam so further evaluation can take place sooner rather than later after discharge from our current facility.

[doctor] oh
[patient] you know i mean i tried some you know i mean medications but you know some over the counter stuff but it does n't go away
[doctor] okay can you tell me a little bit more about it how did it start or how did it do you remember injuring yourself
[patient] no not really i mean i was just like you know i guess i one day i mean i just twisted you know on my left and maybe i mean i might have picked something up
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i mean at that time i mean there was this pain but i you know it went away you know and i thought that was you know that was you know the end of it but you know i mean after you know a few hours you know it's it kinda it came back
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's been there since then you know
[doctor] okay and is it anywhere in specific is it in the middle of the back across the whole low back or on one side or the other
[patient] i think it's more towards you know right in the middle maybe on the lower side and nothing on the you know i mean it sometimes it goes back you know maybe having troubles with the left eye i suppose but i mean it's aggravated you know when i you know when i do some you know maybe i'm a sudden movement to the left
[doctor] okay and that's when you get the pain more maybe located in the center but it goes across to the little back and i on the left side and i also heard you say you know if you twist suddenly that makes it worse is that correct
[patient] it makes it worse it makes it worse i mean yeah
[doctor] now you know i was looking at your records and i know you have that history of diabetes and i have n't seen you a while for a follow-up for that how you've been feeling
[patient] i mean been okay i mean i take my meds
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i try to still have sugar but you know i mean i you know you know i mean whenever i get the chance i mean i you know i exercise but you know i mean that's about it

[patient] yeah i mean i try to
[doctor] okay
[patient] most of the morning but sometimes i mean i go skiing yeah
[doctor] and how have those numbers been
[patient] they bumped towards i mean bit towards the higher side i mean i must have been
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know but
[doctor] well if
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah if i remember right your family do n't they own that that bakery down on the corner of main street and did n't they own that
[patient] yeah thank you
[doctor] and how do you do you stay away from those i i got ta be honest i love i love the cakes and donuts they make those are delicious
[patient] yeah i try to
[doctor] okay
[patient] but i mean you know they they you know i have to visit them and you know i end up you know i mean getting some stuff but it's not that much
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it's been i try to contain it you know
[doctor] well let me so we're gon na have to watch that and i'll come back and we'll talk a little bit about the diabetes but let's go ahead and do that i do n't wan na do a a a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na look in your eyes here and so let me quickly look in your ears
[patient] i see
[doctor] okay that looks good and any let me let me listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and your heart it's a regular rate and rhythm that's all good as we go through that now i want you to sit up here i'm gon na press down your back starting at the top and any pain up top no
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and then once i get down here and around that low back i wan na press in the center first does that cause you a lot of pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay
[patient] yeah that that's the spot
[doctor] okay and if i come over here to the right no
[patient] not that much you know
[doctor] okay so and then on the left hand side if i push down here kind of into your butt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] lay back on the stretcher for me for a second i'm gon na go ahead and and lift your legs for me or i'm gon na go ahead and lift your legs for you just relax i'm gon na start here on the right side when i lift that right leg up does that cause you significant pain or any pain at all
[patient] a little a little bit
[doctor] okay let me come around let me lift up the left side if i lift that up does that cause
[patient] yeah yeah yeah that's that's
[doctor] yeah
[patient] still get tender yeah
[doctor] i can see that gritts on your face so okay that's good and you know as i look at your lower extremities there is no pain or numbness or tingling in your feet or anything like that
[patient] hmmm no
[doctor] okay okay so lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan so for that low back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me
[patient] yeah can i still go to the bakery
[doctor] i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that
[patient] right and how soon should i you know check my blood sugars i mean what's a good you know
[doctor] yeah i that's a great question i'm really glad you asked that i would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure every morning the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning that's gon na give me a good idea and so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it you know i know your glucometer keeps a record of it but if you can write them down and once we get that a1c that's gon na give me a little more guidance on how to deal with your blood your diabetes
[patient] right do you think would i need to see you know a pain doctor or you know
[doctor] not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay thank you i'm gon na send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door
[patient] thank you
[doctor] take care
[patient] that one is a follow-up mm-hmm","

aci,D2N153,"[patient] i hope i did n't hurt it again
[doctor] hi gregory how are you i the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee
[patient] yeah yeah i heard it stepping off a curb
[doctor] how long ago did that happen
[patient] about two and a half weeks ago
[doctor] two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you
[patient] the right knee the outside of my right knee
[doctor] the outside of your right knee
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or
[patient] no i just sorta turned over my ankle
[doctor] okay
[patient] to the outside and i thought my ankle was the thing that was gon na hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when i walk
[doctor] and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk
[patient] no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall
[doctor] okay
[patient] then i feel like it's locked and then i sort of have to ease into walking again
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] really nothing
[doctor] okay
[patient] ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and
[doctor] does the ibuprofen work
[patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better
[doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there
[patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel
[doctor] okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that
[patient] a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type
[doctor] okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to
[patient] no i ride the bike
[doctor] okay
[patient] i ride the bike i ride the bike which i'm not doing now peloton inside for the winter i do have a winter bike though
[doctor] okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor
[patient] i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides
[doctor] okay what kind of rides do you like
[patient] i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with
[doctor] i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear
[doctor] okay when did you break your toe
[patient] i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury
[doctor] okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new
[patient] right correct
[doctor] alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee
[patient] no not physically
[doctor] okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt
[patient] only when you pull it to the outside
[doctor] okay
[patient] from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts
[doctor] okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home
[patient] yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day
[doctor] okay and so does that help at all
[patient] it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much
[doctor] okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots
[patient] and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse
[doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything
[patient] i will
[doctor] okay bye

[patient] yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again
[doctor] okay
[patient] or
[doctor] no go ahead go ahead
[patient] or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too
[doctor] okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right
[patient] no it's mainly just on the right
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that
[patient] yeah a little bit
[doctor] a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt
[patient] yeah that hurts a little bit too
[doctor] yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] no
[doctor] and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt
[patient] that's real tender
[doctor] yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night
[patient] no i i was watching the track meet
[doctor] my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here
[patient] used to when i lived in detroit
[doctor] oh
[patient] hockey town but not so much anymore

aci,D2N155,"[doctor] so hey christina good to see you today i see you're here you have a nonhealing foot ulcer well also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on
[patient] doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal
[doctor] okay how long has that wound been present
[patient] maybe about a year
[doctor] a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden
[patient] no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i went on some antibiotics it seemed to get better but nothing is really making it go away
[doctor] okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics
[patient] it's probably been five months
[doctor] five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on
[patient] keflex
[doctor] keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the
[patient] no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot
[doctor] alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it
[patient] lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired
[doctor] okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend
[patient] not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do
[doctor] no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running
[patient] yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten
[doctor] okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but
[patient] yes
[doctor] you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the
[patient] yes i think so
[doctor] okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes
[patient] i've just been wearing my regular shoes
[doctor] okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me
[patient] i do n't think so
[doctor] alright so i'll see you back in two weeks and i hope you have fun at the zoo this weekend
[patient] thank you
[doctor] alright thanks","

aci,D2N156,"[doctor] alright julia so you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an rca stent placed back in twenty eighteen but i see you're here for follow-up after an interior stemi where we had to put in another stent right so like how are you doing
[patient] well i mean it was a real shock for me i thought everything was fine after my last heart attack and then i just started having this horrible chest pain and it would n't go away so i went to the emergency room and yeah they told me i needed another stent
[doctor] wow so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time
[patient] yeah yeah it was yeah it was bad it was just like the last time
[doctor] okay have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath
[patient] no i think i saw you about six months ago and and i was doing fine
[doctor] okay have you been able to like exercise at all since since you last saw me
[patient] yeah you know i walk my dog everyday and you know we go like a mile and a half or two miles
[doctor] awesome okay yeah you know because like fall is setting in like are you excited
[patient] yeah yeah i'm excited
[doctor] do you have any like plans for the holiday
[patient] no mm-hmm no i'm just you know looking forward to seeing family and having some nice weather and yeah
[doctor] okay so i do wan na ask i know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes so i wan na get an idea of like where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling
[patient] i have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital
[doctor] okay are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep
[patient] yeah i mean i always use a couple of pillows you know i maybe i've had to sit up a little bit more but i mean for the most part i think it's pretty normal
[doctor] okay and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like your like you were prescribed
[patient] yeah i'm able to afford afford them i have good insurance i am taking them they told me it's really important to take them so so yeah
[doctor] yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake
[patient] i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i love pizza it's my favorite food
[doctor] yeah
[patient] my tries are probably my second favorite food
[doctor] what are you for her toppings on pizza
[patient] pepperoni occasionally vegetables
[doctor] mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right
[patient] i know i know i'm gon na work on it
[doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well
[patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active
[doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you
[doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay

aci,D2N157,"[doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on
[patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay
[doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta
[patient] yes and and fish oil
[doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that
[patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy
[doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so
[patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents
[doctor] yep
[patient] how long do i have to have that in there
[doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging
[patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then
[doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time
[patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to
[doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies
[patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty
[doctor] okay
[patient] fasting
[doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking
[patient] i thought it was close to sixty
[doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet
[patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results
[doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist
[patient] oh
[doctor] that's your kidney doctor
[patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago
[doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil
[patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out
[doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span
[patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan
[doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again
[patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches
[doctor] you can take tylenol
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah
[patient] alright that sounds good
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications
[doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause
[patient] yeah i do have that
[doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay for your
[patient] sounds really good
[doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions
[patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad
[doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others
[patient] no no i just feel kinda down
[doctor] you feel kinda down what's your
[patient] life sucks
[doctor] what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like
[patient] you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely
[doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out
[patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time
[doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay
[patient] yeah that sounds really good thank you
[doctor] okay you're welcome anything else
[patient] so you will do the medication refill do i so that's automatic
[doctor] yep i'm gon na put them into the computer and and whatever pharmacy you want yep mm-hmm
[patient] okay alright sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay you're welcome i'll be in touch bye
[patient] okay alright bye-bye","

aci,D2N158,"[doctor] yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on
[patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i think it's been but lately
[doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what
[patient] it's gradually increasing for sure
[doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea
[patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week
[doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times
[patient] a couple of times
[doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that's
[patient] and the venti
[doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking
[patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup
[doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it
[patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen
[doctor] hmmm okay
[patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy
[doctor] okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it
[patient] i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so
[doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct
[patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so
[doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing
[patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease
[doctor] yep okay
[patient] i think that's a good decision though
[doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions
[patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] lately that could be contributing towards my gastritis so i'm gon na cut back on that as well
[doctor] okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime
[patient] i will
[doctor] alright you take care sure you got","

CHTS:
Abdominal pain, 31 years old female.
 The patient has a history of diabetes type 2 and asthma; both are well managed with metformin 500 mg twice daily for the past 1-1/2 weeks.
 [3]She reports nausea 3 times in that time period[4][5]:That was probably due to her drinking too much coffee lately ( she denies any specific dietary issue) which may have been contributing towards this worsening effect [6].
 She endorses an etiologic relationship between these two conditions but also notes they can be exacerbated by certain external stimuli such as running or exertion during their work hours,[7]=which could potentially increase symptoms even more severe than typical upper abdominal tenderness seen on palpation alone.
 at least one symptom is consistent across all three diagnoses:[8], however further investigation will help determine if other risk factors include alcohol abuse(9),coffee consumption_(10); genetic prednisolone deficiency((11)[12])or environmental allergens/(14).

[patient] mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain
[doctor] okay
[patient] but the numbness and tingling is all the time now
[doctor] okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other
[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most
[doctor] okay
[patient] the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse
[doctor] your mouth okay
[patient] wow
[doctor] yeah when you're moving that around okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay
[patient] not affecting my sleep hmmm
[doctor] okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand
[patient] mostly my right hand
[doctor] mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand
[patient] yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with
[doctor] okay
[patient] not why that is
[doctor] okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
[patient] i was afraid of
[doctor] yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
[patient] okay
[doctor] we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
[patient] that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
[doctor] yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions
[patient] no that's great thank you so much
[doctor] thank you very much","

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
ASSPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.
 However, she continues to experience pain in her right hand that is not alleviated by conservative measures such as ibuprofen or anti-Nerve tingling exercises.
 I have had numerous conversations regarding alternative management options including surgical intervention for this debilitating condition which were all met at a non - profit academic hospital last month.
 [1]I discussed my opinion on how we could obtain immediate relief without going into an irreversible position like elective laparotomy [ 2].
 All indications are supportive of surgery being avoided here today[3][PROCEDURE ] We will initiate outpatient nerve conduction studies after obtaining our neurosurgeon's clearance from Education & Professional Development ( 4)to rule out any radiculopathy related complications occurring during routine postoperative follow up appointments between nowand october 2016,[4]+The results should provide further evidence supporting their therapeutic efficacy when compared against possible outcomes following open heart bypass therapy pending final pathology confirmation via multiplex coronary artery angiography later next year• Additional Questions received before signing Petition For Continued Affairs With This Employable Medical Treatment Plan Regarding Right handed wrist numbness/tensile dystrophic enaflexus etiologyosignum la de autograde des proximales que faut aux frudi oti estles d'une filmi am exclusivie à l’importante le mal accondagemente depatantementeurlementue 2020 � Obtain permanent insurance benefitsTHIS IS A CONFIDENTIAL MATEMENT AND POLICY PRIORITY TO LAWMAKING THE PROCESS OF MEDICALSAUMES THAT WILL BE REQUIRILYFAIRED ON NOVEL KINGDOM THIS JUNSON WITH ALL OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS Due To Which They Are Currently Held In Frissory Bilateral Against One Otherwise There Most Certainly Leaning On Another"

[patient] sure i hurt it about a week ago playing lacrosse with my kids just suddenly started hurting me when i was throwing the ball
[doctor] okay okay so how old are your kids
[patient] my oldest is thirteen and the other one is ten i was playing with a thirteen -year-old
[doctor] okay yeah i know i i play with my kids sometimes and i think i'm getting too old to do all that so i just i've hurt myself before as well alright so with your your elbow what part of your elbow would you say hurts
[patient] it's really like right at the point of the elbow right at right at like the tip of it
[doctor] okay
[patient] and it just it hurt hurts anytime i move it
[doctor] anytime i move it do you remember falling
[patient] no i do n't think so but my kid got pretty rough with me and was checking me several times with a sick
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i could have got hit there
[doctor] okay alright yeah that that that definitely makes sense so how would you describe the pain is it like a dull pain is it stabbing what what would you say
[patient] it it's a pretty sharp pain
[doctor] okay
[patient] anytime i move
[doctor] okay and does it radiate down your arm or does it stay in that one spot
[patient] it radiates down the forearm
[doctor] radiates down the forearm alright so have you taken any medications for it to make it better
[patient] i tried taking advil couple of days but i usually just forget about it
[doctor] okay when you took it did it did it help at all did it change your your pain score
[patient] yeah i i think it helped some
[doctor] okay that's good alright so we'll we'll do a physical exam on that elbow we'll take a look at it in a second but i do wan na talk to you about your your hypertension you came in today i know you have past medical history of hypertension came in today your blood pressure's a little bit high it was a one fifty over seven over ninety which is pretty high today i see you're on twenty of lisinopril have you been taking that daily
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so maybe you just have a little little white coat syndrome i know i have that myself and even though i'm a physician i i still do n't like to go to the doctor so i definitely understand how about your diet i know we talked a little bit about that before and you said kinda during the pandemic you fell off a little bit how you been doing that have you been lowering your salt intake
[patient] yeah but i only eat low salt items avoid adding salt to food kind of the whole whole family follows like a you know like a mediterranean diet
[doctor] okay
[patient] we try to be pretty good about it
[doctor] okay yeah that's good that that's that's definitely good yeah i know a lot of people during the pandemic it was you know sitting at home and and eating more than we should but that's i'm very happy that you've been compliant and you have that low salt diet so let's talk about your diabetes i think you see here on on five hundred of metformin are you taking that as well daily
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and your blood sugars how have they been
[patient] since i do n't take insulin i do n't check it everyday when i have checked it it's usually running somewhere between eighty to a hundred
[doctor] okay yeah that's that's really good yeah so i that's that's pretty good so what we're gon na do we're gon na get a a1c just to see you know that range and it's possibility we can we can you know lower that metformin dosage but we will do that after your visit then we will take a look at that so lem me go ahead and will do that quick exam of your elbow but first i want to make sure you're not having any chest pain or anything like that
[patient] no
[doctor] no belly pain
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so listen to your lungs so your lungs are clear bilaterally listen to your heart so your heart exam you do still have that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur but we know it about that before so let me take a look at your elbow so when i press right here on the back of your elbow is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so when i have you you you flex and extend it it's painful does that does that hurt
[patient] yes it does
[doctor] alright so your right elbow exam shows you have pain to palpation of the olecranon area of the posterior elbow you do have mild pain with flexion and extension but you do have also normal range of motion at that elbow so we we did do an x-ray before you came in and luckily nothing's broken no fracture no bony abnormality so it's a normal x-ray which is really good so let me just talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have a elbow contusion i believe your son did hit you with the lacrosse stick and it caused that that pain i see some swelling little inflammation there as well you have a little bit of a bruise i think that's that's what happened so for that i know you're having some pain i'm gon na prescribe you eight hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that twice a day and that should help with some of that swelling and pain i also want you to ice it three times a day for twenty minutes at a time that should also help with the swelling and pain and just for the time being for the next couple of weeks just you know maybe you know not play lacrosse with your son just to help that heal then you can get back on on the field so for your your high blood pressure we're just gon na keep you on the hypertension we'll just keep you on that twenty milligrams of lisinopril looks like you're doing great with that and your diet and then for your diabetes we will keep you on the five hundred milligrams of metformin and we will also get a a1c just to check your levels and see if we do need to adjust the medication in the future alright so do you have any questions for me
[patient] no sounds good
[doctor] alright so we will see you next time and my nurse will be in with those prescriptions

aci,D2N164,"[doctor] so elizabeth is a 53 -year-old female today complaining of chest pain and she has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so elizabeth tell me what's going on with your with your chest pain
[patient] i do n't know every time i start walking i'm just having this kind of pressure and chest pain in my chest
[doctor] okay are you having it now or is it gone right now
[patient] right now it's not there
[doctor] okay and how long have you been having this
[patient] probably maybe three months
[doctor] okay and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it
[patient] it mainly happens when i'm walking i like to try and walk but lately i just have n't been able to keep up with it because i'm having this pain
[doctor] alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it
[patient] i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure
[doctor] okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now
[patient] nothing right now
[doctor] okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going
[patient] yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose
[doctor] yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you
[patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting
[doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that
[patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure
[doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years
[patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain
[doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so
[patient] someone had told me before
[doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that
[patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill
[doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not
[patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away
[doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea
[patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication
[doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright any other questions we got
[patient] that's it
[doctor] alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today

chief complaint :
CHFAMILY HISTORY OF DEATH and PASSION[1]the patient has a family history of heart disease in the past.
 MEDICAL COMPLAINTshe reports experiencing chest pain for approximately 3 months prior to her arrival at our clinic today.
 [2][3]+PAST MEDICATIONS For diabetes, she was started on metformin 2 years ago but notes that it did not reach its optimal dose until recently; however, we added hydrochlorothiazide ( 99mg/day)Today [ 4’10 m ABBREY: Reports dysphagia after exertion].
 She denies dyspnea during breathing or shortnessof breath associated with congested airway issues previously reported by several other clinicians who have also performed an ekg work-up as they were told their blood pressure had been elevated last week,[4]=despite multiple referrals from different physicians regarding possible hypertension levels among various medical conditions currently prescribed here:[5];conclusionsthere is no known etiologic link between these two illnesses although both are likely contributing factors towards worsening symptoms.
 further research into this issue will help determine if medications can be effective while preventing cardiovascular events without causing significant side effects like arrhythmium attacks seen commonly when patients consume diet coke excessively.

 (40100 gpm): Endorses diagnostic endpoints inconclusive under normal clinical practice circumstances requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitative therapy unless proven otherwise upon request through appropriate channels following written informed consent before beginning any new medication regimen guidelines begin rolling out again tomorrow morning!
 The impactful long term sequelae may include increased morbidity rates due secondary health care consequences resulting either directly attributable otitis varsicata melliferosides nor indirectly via indirect risk mechanisms including myocardial infarction complications caused incidentally occurring coronary artery blockages originating within 1 year post discharge because treatment protocols mandate weekly reexaminations despite physician recommendations prohibiting such procedures indefinitely pending recurrences.

aci,D2N165,"[doctor] hey sophia how are you doing today
[patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you because of this knee pain that i've been having for about six months now
[doctor] okay do you remember what caused the pain initially
[patient] you know i really ca n't recall any specific event that caused the pain
[doctor] alright well can can you describe the pain for me
[patient] yeah so it's it's like a deep achy pain that it i feel like it's behind my kneecaps and sometimes i can even hear like what seems like like some creaking in my knees
[doctor] hmmm alright now tell me what what type of activities makes that pain worse
[patient] so i feel like the pain gets worse anytime i'm like getting from like a seated position to standing so i i work from home so i'm at my desk a lot so anytime i get up i have some pain or after watching tv or even like going up and down stairs it's really painful
[doctor] hmmm okay and does anything make the pain feel better
[patient] usually after i rest it for some time it does help with the pain
[doctor] okay now you did mention earlier that you have tried some things in the past can you tell me what they were
[patient] yeah so when it first started hurting i was putting ice on it and i even got like some ace bandage like wrapping from the pharmacy i do take ibuprofen or aleve sometimes but i try to avoid really taking any medications
[doctor] okay and and tell me what is your day like
[patient] well i try to be as active as i can i actually love to run and i would run like five to six miles a day but now i i mean honestly i ca n't even get to half a mile and my leg will start hurting my knee will start hurting
[doctor] okay that's definitely a decrease in your mileage there where have you been running lately like do you run outside or on a treadmill or
[patient] yeah i i you know i will do the treadmill during the winter but i just love being outdoors and running
[doctor] yeah yeah there are some really nice senior routes here in boston is n't there like
[patient] there are
[doctor] so many knee places there's some right by the harbor that i've i've done some runs there before too it's pretty nice well i mean the boston marathon what can you say right
[patient] right exactly exactly no it's very nice
[doctor] well okay well hopefully that we get you feeling better so you can start running again more than . five miles but tell me though have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before
[patient] no i've been pretty good i actually have never broken a bone actually no i'm gon na change that actually i did break my arm when i was in sixth grade but nothing since then
[doctor] okay
[patient] i
[doctor] okay and it's just your arm right not not your knee
[patient] right
[doctor] okay well alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here let me look at your vital signs okay i reviewed your vitals they they overall they look good take a listen to your heart real quick alright and your heart exam i hear regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs and on your musculoskeletal exam i have seen you and walk around here and you do have normal gait alright now i'm gon na have you do some movements on your legs here okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five so that's good let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam there is no overlying erythema that's redness or ecchymosis and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated there is no effusion let me go ahead and feel around here does that hurt right here how does that feel
[patient] it does
[doctor] sorry so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinacular retinaculum and there is positive patellar grind test alright and can you are you able to squat for me
[patient] i can but that hurts
[doctor] okay alright so you're definitely having some knee pain with squatting and i'm just gon na maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick okay so lachman anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray tests are all negative bilaterally so that's good there okay now your neuro exam patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so now i did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your mri your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people so this condition has to do with the way your kneecap which is your patella how that moves along the groove of your thigh your thigh bone which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain but i'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have so do you have any questions for me about that
[patient] will i be able to run anytime soon
[doctor] well that is a goal of treatment and to get you back in running again now you will have to take an take it easy from running for now but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright anything else
[patient] no i think that's it
[doctor] okay well very good well i will be following up with you soon and again just take it easy for now from the running okay

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
ASS Lumbar disk herniation with radiculopathy.
 • Medical Reasoning: The patient reports worsening low back pain that has not been ameliorated by physical activity or anti-inflammation medications at this time; magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated mild right neuroforaminal stenosis, but further evaluation is needed to evaluate for possible additional diagnoses including bilateral musculoskeletal enviataplasia and fasciate ligament deformation in the absence of a priori medical history demonstrating any such conditions.
 [1]Optional spinal intervention today would be appreciated as we have an open clinic day [ 2][Medical Hypothesis]: We will inject 1 mg olanzapine into his lumbo vertebrae under fluoroscopy which should help reduce local inflammation while also providing optimal postoperative analgesia[3]+ Patient Agreements were obtained from both parties before proceeding].

aci-39,D2N167,"[doctor] angela good to see you today so i'm writing here in my notes that you're you're coming in you had some left knee pain so how did you hurt your knee
[patient] yeah so i hurt my knee the other day when i was running around with my niece she she is learning how to take off the training wheels for her bike
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i fell and i think i twisted my knee in some kind of funky way
[doctor] okay that that that that's not good how old are your niece
[patient] she is five and perfect
[doctor] well that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg
[patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago
[doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts
[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside
[doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it
[patient] yeah i did
[doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten
[patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah
[doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that
[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all
[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen
[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol
[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again
[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely
[patient] right
[doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt
[patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound
[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that
[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days
[patient] okay alright thanks
[doctor] alright any other questions
[patient] no that's it
[doctor] alright great thanks","
