virtscribe,VS012,"[doctor] michelle king , date of birth 1/5/1986 , mrn q227631 . new patient visit for acid reflux . past medical history of anxiety and seasonal allergies . [patient] hello , are you mrs. king ? [doctor] i am . [patient] i'm dr. phillips , very nice to meet you . [doctor] you as well . [patient] how can i help you today ? [doctor] well , my primary doctor , dr. scott , he referred me here . [patient] okay . [doctor] i've just got really bad acid reflux . [patient] okay . can you tell me more about it ? [doctor] yeah . so i mean i , right now i take 40 mg of omeprazole twice a day . some days it is fine , but others are just really bad . what do you feel ? [patient] it feels like burning . [doctor] in your chest ? [patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat . [doctor] in your throat and chest , alright . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ? [patient] no , not really . [doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ? [patient] no . [doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ? [patient] nope . [doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ? [patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years . [doctor] okay and how long have you been on the omeprazole ? [patient] on the way it is now i think about a year . [doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ? i mean i can tell it's helped because some days i'll be fine and then some days i eat something and it feels terrible . are there anything that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint like food choices or stress ? sure , probably stress and food choices sometimes . okay . what things bother you ? [patient] spicy foods so i try not to eat them too often but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it . we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that even sodas even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato based products or citrus products ? [doctor] yeah sometimes but i still eat them . okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing though . how has your weight been ? pretty stable ? [patient] i would say pretty stable although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past 2 months . i have been under a lot of work stress . [doctor] what do you do for work ? [patient] i'm a paralegal . [doctor] okay and any family history of gi issues ? [patient] my grandmother had esophageal cancer . [doctor] on your mom or dad's side ? [patient] mom's side and my mom had some issues like acid reflux and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach . [doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ? [patient] i think maybe when i was younger . [doctor] but not in the last 10 years ? [patient] no . [doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ? [patient] at one point i was on omeprazole and ranitidine , it did help . [doctor] but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken . [patient] okay . have a seat here and let me listen to your heart and lungs and then we can talk about a plan for you . [doctor] okay . so normal physical exam per my new patient template except for a well-healed abdominal surgical scar is noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ? i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around 1 month old . gotcha , okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . [patient] and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole 40 mg twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ? [doctor] yes . and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated beverages , citrus , and tomato based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . [patient] so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd even though you're taking the ppi . [doctor] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods . [patient] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms . [doctor] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me . so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium . that's fine with me , i'm definitely open to trying whatever . perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 mg twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd or upper endoscopy to look for potential causes of the gerd . we sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth down your throat , through your stomach and end in the small intestines . [patient] we would look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything . [doctor] okay . can i schedule that today ? yeah , you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary stress and medication changes . how does all of that sound ? [patient] that sounds good . [doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the check out desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment . please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","

virtscribe,VS018,"[patient] next patient is michelle king , date of birth 5/7/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to l on 6/29/2021 and was discharged on 7/2/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with i.v . antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a suprapubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . [doctor] hi michelle , how are you doing ? [patient] not too bad and yourself ? [doctor] i'm good , thanks . so it looks like you had an infection , right ? [patient] yeah but you know i really do n't think it was a uti . [doctor] okay . [patient] i told them when i went to the er is that your phone . [doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to your knee and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . tell me what's going on . [patient] it is in my humble opinion that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home , i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted and they did x-rays and everything , but they said no , as they did n't think that was n't , that was it . but you know i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped . okay white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count . [doctor] typically it does n't . [patient] okay . [doctor] but i mean when i look at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [patient] yeah , that's what they said . and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit and last year it was normal so . [doctor] hmmm . but it's saying that you know inflammation can do that , so yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [patient] yeah . [doctor] they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray but you feel like you are back to your normal self now ? [patient] yeah . i mean i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up and i know at that point i'm out of the loss of what i can do at home . yeah that you went in . so i went in and they made me feel better and then i went home as you know . [doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [patient] yeah . [doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [patient] yes , i am . [doctor] good . lem me take a quick listen to you . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , go ahead and take a few deep breaths and breathe normally . [patient] now take several deep breaths . [doctor] two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [patient] no . [doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [patient] okay . you may recall it was extremely hot during that period of going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part . yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot . okay well if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit , it can lead to further or worsening constipation issues . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff and i blame it a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last 2 weeks of june so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then if you could come back in and we could do some complete blood work including your white blood cells and a full panel , cholesterol since it's been a while . [doctor] okay . [patient] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now but maybe if i put some labs in you can come in in 2 to 3 weeks . sure , i can do that . great . so no appointment , but let's two birds with 1 stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . okay . and then i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay because if it remains elevated , then that means there is something else going on with your bowels . [doctor] mm-hmm i do n't think that's what we will find , but we will see . [patient] i mean i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while even though i drink the miralax everyday . [doctor] yeah . [patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that . have i ever given you laxatives would be a medicine you use in conjunction with miralax sort of a rescue type thing . is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ? yes . then yes , i have it . it takes about 2 days to work and then it's a brutal 2 days . got it , yeah , it can be a little rough but it works . [doctor] yeah . [patient] alright , so we have our plan , any questions ? yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid if we can . sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ? i am unvaccinated . so what are your concerns about the vaccine ? well , we do n't know the side effect . correct , we do n't . it's too soon to tell the side effects and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as vaccine injury . right . right . which i had never heard of before , i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to be even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c. okay . [doctor] alright . [patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored so i guess i do n't feel as though i really need the vaccine . well my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid , it's not going to be good for you . [doctor] okay . [patient] and i think it's safe . i mean i understand and hear you , all of these stories out there about this and regarding the vaccine but i have seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice and i do n't disagree . [doctor] that if you got covid , you'd probably be okay . [patient] yeah . [doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i've had healthy people die from covid . [patient] mm-hmm . i've had some people get really , really sick from it , so personally i believe that this vaccine is completely safe , i really think that . [doctor] all of them ? [patient] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines so you have to go back and think about it . do you get the flu shot every year ? no , i do n't . right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making consistent viewpoint . well , i am open minded today . hmmm to me it's you know a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we have seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] the er is full of these vaccines . [doctor] i understand . [patient] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine , i mean there is bar and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . i think for you is i'm not convinced that there is alternative stuff or even the treatment we have like the monoclonal antibodies that will give help but it's just my opinion . well that's what i'm here for . yeah , and right now the numbers are low even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly . [doctor] okay . [patient] so that's what's gon na happen with covid , that's what's most , most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end is that the virus starts losing it's potency . [doctor] sure . but think about it and if you have any more questions , you can certainly let me know , okay ? [patient] will do . [doctor] alright , anything else we can discuss today ? [patient] nope , i think i am okay , thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . so we will see you in 2 to 3 weeks , have a good rest of your day . [patient] thanks , you too . headache will be acute to chronic constipation . she believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her reflexia from her quadriplegia that typically occurs she did have a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis . i would recommend just in the next three or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs . [doctor] and we will repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells trend downward . and heading will be quadriplegia . [patient] and heading will be covid vaccine status . again , she is hesitant . we had a good discussion and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe the supplements are necessarily going to help save this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid , however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .","
CHIEF COMPLAINT OF PRESENT ILLNESS 39-year-old female, female with history of quadriplegia due to prior spinal cord injury, presents today for follow-up regarding concerns related to fever, febrile, significant constipation, significant urinary tract infection, elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, antibiotic therapy, labile blood pressure, headache, and vomiting, and was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms. She denies urinary tract infections. She states she was constipated when she was in the emergency department and denies she had an infection. She believes her constipation was the cause of her blood pressure being so high and she hardly pooped while she was there. When she returned home, she had a massive poop and she felt much better. 
objective_exam: #####EMPTY#####.xg#.xyz.v.c.g.t.s. frequency: high.
°C, systolic ejection murmur, pitting edema, and edema of the bilateral lower extremities. Decreased heart rate, gallops, and respirations. Alert white blood cell count of 23,000. White cell count was the only thing they were concerned about. Normal last year. Automatic dysreflexia does not affect the white cell count. Decrease white cell counts. Backed up and inflamed white count.
objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.
X-rays and reviewed urinalysis were obtained and reviewed in the emergency department. There were concerns about ongoing urinary tract infection. The patient was treated with i.v. antibiotic therapy. She was discharged on 7/2/2021. White cell count was elevated at 23,000, which is normal. No obvious signs of infection were noted. No osteoarthritis was noted. White count was the only thing that the doctors were concerned about. No evidence of automatic dysreflexia could be present. No clear signs of arthritis could be identified. No abnormal bone marrow was identified. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLANMichelle King is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to prior spinal cord injury. She presents today to follow up regarding her symptoms. She was admitted to hospital on 6/29/2021 and was discharged on 7/2/2020. She presented today with an elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, fever, labile blood pressure, headache, nausea, and vomiting. There were concerns for an ongoing urinary tract infection, but she was treated with i.v. antibiotic therapy and was eventually discharged after clinical improvement. Her white cell count was slightly elevated, but not dangerously so. She is constipated, but this appears to be rectal related. We will order a colonoscopy and stool culture to rule out any urinary tract infections. I advised her to drink plenty of fluids and follow up with me in 2 weeks to see if her constipation has worsened. I also recommended we obtain a urine culture, as well as a hemoglobin A1c and hemoglobin B1c. We also discussed the importance of maintaining a healthy weight. I explained to the patient that her blood pressure was elevated due to anemia, which could be related to an infection"
virtscribe,VS020,"[doctor] okay , next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female who is previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . [patient] hi , good afternoon ashley , how are you doing ? [doctor] i'm doing okay . how are you ? [patient] i'm doing well , thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers , i'm one of your kidney doctors and you guys must be mom and dad . [doctor] yes , that's correct . great . well , alright , it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we are gon na figure it all out here today . speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , [patient] and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kinda move from there . would that be alright with you , ashley ? [doctor] yeah , that sounds good . [patient] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small , a kind of a small kidney on one side . [doctor] tell me about when that was . i do also have records of everything , but i just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here today . [patient] sure so ashley came home 1 day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach and she said it was hurting her on her right side and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain . [doctor] okay . [patient] they automatically thought appendix . [doctor] sure that makes a lot of sense . we took her to her doctor , they treated her for a stomach virus , they gave her fluids and sent her back home and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day . [patient] goodness , okay . than what happened . [doctor] yeah , so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger . [patient] okay . [doctor] then at that time , they told us to follow up with our primary the next day , which we did but he was heading out on vacation so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up in a lot of pain so i took work off to help her . [patient] wow okay . [doctor] we took her down to jacksonville where they did see her and basically told us the same thing that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one . [patient] already then , then what happened . [doctor] yeah , then they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . they told us to follow up with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick . [patient] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [doctor] yeah , it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was course still out of town with no one to see her in his place , so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about 4 days . they did see her and treated her . [patient] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some late at the end of that tunnel . [doctor] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since . but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach . [patient] hmmm . okay . [doctor] yeah and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that . alrighty , okay , well that was a really good review . so ashley before all of this , would you say that all in all you were a pretty healthy child ? she is , yeah , before that , she was completely fine . they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might have affected her kidney . [patient] gotcha . okay . so one other thing too when she was 4 years old , she was in the hospital three or four times sometimes for 3 days at a time . i do n't think they did any test to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . they just gave her fluids , an antibiotic and they would send us home . [doctor] hmmm . [patient] okay . [doctor] yeah and so a week or two later she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months and then it just stopped , so she had no problems since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's alright or if , if it needs to be taken out , maybe , we wan na do whatever needs to be done . [patient] yes , absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll , we'll get you through for that . is it ashley taking any medications daily right now ? [doctor] only pepcid . [patient] okay . [doctor] yeah , so she takes 40 mg of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies . [patient] alrighty and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? [doctor] no . renal disease does run in my family though . my dad , aunt and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnosis . [patient] great . i will definitely review that over . any other family history to be aware of ? [doctor] yes , my mom had breast cancer too . [patient] okay . great . alrighty . so just over a quick review , it does look like your your father had a kidney transplant , is that correct ? [doctor] yes , that is correct , he did . [patient] okay , so obstructive neuropathy . sounds like he was born with it and something something made it , so he could n't urinate correctly , does that sound right ? [doctor] yes , and they did n't catch it in time . [patient] i'm so sorry to hear that . [doctor] yeah , he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack . [patient] my goodness . wow , i am so sorry to hear that . but thank you so much for you know all of these pieces really help knit the story together for ashley so we can get her the best care . [doctor] you're welcome . okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease . [patient] yes , well it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt . [doctor] okay and okay i'm looking here . [patient] it looks like , do you know what the name of diagnosis , it does n't seem to be mentioned . [doctor] this is what she sent me . endstage renal disease , chronic kidney disease , stage v , diabetes , hypertension , that's all i have to work on for her . [patient] okay and that's okay , let me see if that is all when she was an adult when all of that happened ? [doctor] correct , yeah . [patient] already . okay . [doctor] and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist where they did n't find anything clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did . [patient] yes . [doctor] okay . so that's all good . so ashley a few questions for you if that's alright . how are you feeling right now ? not feeling too bad , my stomach just hurts just a little bit , it's burning a little bit . [patient] okay and any pain when you go pee ? [doctor] sometimes it's just hard to start sometimes . [patient] okay and any blood in your pee ? no , not that i've noticed . [doctor] okay . [patient] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks like soda so she will only drink gatorade or water . [doctor] okay , yeah , so we do see that some people are very sensitive when they drink certain items , especially the carbonation it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate okay so lot of different pictures of her kidneys here and we'll review all of that here in a moment . [patient] okay . [doctor] alrighty , but before i review that , i wan na look through a quick exam and just see how things are doing . you will hear me speak a loud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented . [patient] okay . [doctor] alrighty , please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart if you will just breathe normally for me , okay ? [patient] okay . [doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . alrighty . so your physical exam you know everything seem appears you know you are well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today i hope with no acute distress . exam otherwise within , within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us . the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as , as does her blood pressure . we want to keep an eye on both of those things as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria . [patient] which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end up seeing protein in your pee . [doctor] okay . [patient] or excuse me herpes . her right kidney is a little bit smaller , which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on , but nothing for us to do with anything today . [doctor] okay . thank you . [patient] i also recommend that on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function . [doctor] complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her in her pee and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead . okay , that sounds good . [patient] okay and does ashley play any sports ? [doctor] yes , she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer . [patient] how fun , i used to play soft ball back in the day . so it'll be very important that during those activity she stays well hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least 2 l/day of water . [doctor] okay , great . we will work on that . okay . i also recommend a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult , so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses . we can do that . we already do try to eat very well . [patient] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have to come all the way out here . [doctor] okay , that sounds great . [patient] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if certainly if symptoms worse . [doctor] no , i do n't have any additional questions and i'll , i'll definitely give you a , a phone call if we do and thank you so much . this was so helpful . [patient] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip and ashley it was really nice to meet you . mom and dad , he was well and i hope you guys take care . [doctor] you too . alrighty , past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral valves and obstructive neuropathy . he developed chronic kidney disease and was on was dialysis dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . is that right ? now that you've started it does , i do n't understand that he unless they were giving the grandfather's record , but did you wan na do this on your own , this recording ? [patient] yeah , that's yeah , that will work because i'm gon na have to drop for this , but i think we're good for everything else . [doctor] and he did die in his 40s , that's what it said in the note earlier . [patient] okay . yeah , he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack , died at 47 , of a mess . [doctor] he died , it , it's saying that meant means that he died on like he was , he was utilizing dialysis . [patient] not because of it , okay . [doctor] yeah . [patient] cool , i'm gon na stop that .","

virtscribe,VS022,"[doctor] patient mrn abc 123 . date of birth january 1 , 1960 . patient is a 60-year-old right handed male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling . hello mr. cook , how are you doing this morning ? [patient] hi dr. martinez , this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now . [doctor] so it's in both of your hands ? [patient] yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them , well once they healed i mean i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness , [doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ? [patient] no , i also wear the left sometimes , the right is just worse but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month and i broke them my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident and they told me it was a contusion . [doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ? [patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here on the other side , it's from here to here . [doctor] i see . so on the right side you're pointing from the middle and ring finger all the way up the forearm and on the left the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ? it's mainly just sore , sometimes they throb but overall they feel weaker too especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull . [patient] and when do you feel these symptoms ? well , really i guess just more so at night and they come and go throughout the day . [doctor] okay and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ? [patient] like feeling something , no , not that i can really think of though in general they maybe less sensitive than they should be but i can still feel they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should . [doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ? [patient] yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet . [doctor] and no history of thyroid issues , correct ? [patient] no . [doctor] ri thank you mr. cook okay first we'll go over your review of systems correct me if i'm wrong in any of this constitutional you have fatigue and weight gain gi you have excessive appetite and bloating eyes have floaters , cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling , endocrine , you're always hungry , skin , you have some nailbed changes , dryness , and itching , musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain , and the remainder of the review of systems is negative . [patient] yeah , that's all correct . [doctor] alright we are going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ? [patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers . [doctor] sensation is normal except pinprick sensation diminished in the third and fourth fingers on the right and how about on the left ? [patient] yeah but these two are little less . [doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left . okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric . 2+ knees , toes are downgoing bilaterally . alright , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ? [patient] yeah , it feels like a zing of my wrist and something into my elbow too . [doctor] and how about the left side ? [patient] yeah , same on that side too . [doctor] tinel's sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal . alright so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or potentially this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as the nerves in your wrist are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me . okay . so how we make it better ? first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we will need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you're having your issues . [patient] that sounds fine to me . [doctor] great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery . you could also refer , we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment . [patient] sounds good document . [doctor] alright keep wearing your splints and i will see you after those studies . [patient] thank you .","

CHIEF COMPLAINT Shirley Taylor is a 60-year-old right-handed female new patient referred by dr. Jacob Ward for evaluation of bilateral hand numbness and tingling. Shirley reports she has had this numbness in both of her hands since last December when she broke her right wrist. She is still wearing a splint, however, the right wrist has not improved since that time. The numbness is mainly on the right side, extending from the middle finger all the way up to the forearm and left pinky and ring finger. There is no pain associated with the numbness. Shirley describes her symptoms mainly as sore, throbbing, and dull. When she is using her hands, the pain and numbness are worse.
