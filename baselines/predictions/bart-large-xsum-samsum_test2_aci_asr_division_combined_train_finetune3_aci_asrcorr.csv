aci,ACI056,"[doctor] hey good morning bobby how are you
[patient] i'm doing okay i as you're aware doctor miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that i've had for several weeks they did he did an ultrasound and and said i had gallstones and they recommended i stay several way from some high fat food but i'm just still having a lot of pain and he referred me to you
[doctor] alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel
[patient] well it's it's on the right hand side of my belly it's it's right underneath my ribs and it feels like a a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes but when it comes it's really severe and i get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach
[doctor] okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life
[patient] when it's severe it's it's probably an eight
[doctor] okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you
[patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know i like to eat right
[doctor] do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit
[patient] well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i've cut back on sugar and i started a little bit of a keto diet and i've lost about twenty five pounds over the last three months
[doctor] okay so other than the weight loss how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you i mean do you does does that does that fit your lifestyle pretty well
[patient] yeah it does it does it it i was surprised it was n't as hard as i thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet
[doctor] okay
[patient] but you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better
[doctor] yeah
[patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs
[doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake
[patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain
[doctor] okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease
[patient] yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off
[doctor] okay so both both your parents your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay and then i wan na talk a little bit about your activity level and your and and if you're exercising has this affected your ability to to get out and exercise
[patient] not really i mean i usually i got ta watch it around meals you know but i've never been a big exerciser right after eating anyhow but you know i'm i'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get back out and you know i love photography i i love nature of photography and with the with the the woods going from you know that dark barron look to coming alive with that green and and butting i i love to get out and take foot photographs there
[doctor] that's awesome to hear yeah i my wife and i like to go over and take nature hikes through the new park behind the rex center that just opened up have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've got a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago
[patient] no i have n't been there i might have to try that out yeah
[doctor] yeah it's awesome
[patient] i like to get down near the river that's where i i like to catch especially around spring time
[doctor] that's great yeah next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that'd be awesome to see
[patient] okay cool
[doctor] so i'm just curious talking about your symptoms here have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea but have you actually vomited from those symptoms
[patient] there's times when the pain is really bad for a couple of days i've had some what i i would describe as low grade fevers and yes you're right i have feel nauseated but i have n't thrown up
[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam your vital signs look good today blood pressure was one twenty eight over eighty eight respiratory rate was sixteen your pulse rate was sixty eight you were afebrile today which is a good thing and your oxygen saturation on room air was ninety nine percent taking a listen to your heart here your heart is regular of rate and rhythm no i do n't hear any ectopic beats no clicks rubs or murmurs noted listening to your lungs here they are clear and equal bilaterally to auscultation now i'm gon na go ahead and do an an abdominal exam i do note positive bowel sounds soft nondistended abdomen however you are positive for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant but i do n't note any rebound tenderness now i'm gon na press slightly here beneath your ribs on the right hand side now take a breath in does that hurt when i press
[doctor] so i i see that you're guarded there so i'm gon na say that that it did hurt when i it did hurt when i
[patient] absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there
[doctor] okay
[patient] sorry i was just trying to capture capture my breath
[doctor] okay that's that's no problem so you are positive for murphy's signs but i do n't appreciate any peritoneal signs so let's talk a little bit about your results that i reviewed before you came in today so your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder and i do appreciate some mild thickening now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four . one millimeters now let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay i do believe you have some mild cholecystitis with gallstones i do n't appreciate any frank obstruction but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed and it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now since you have n't had any improvement with dietary modifications i am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder and i would like to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy now what that means is i'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's gon na remove that gallbladder through one of those little bitty incisions now the surgery is gon na take about an hour to an hour and a half and you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just wan na monitor you post procedure to make sure everything is okay you're still gon na wan na avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are gon na be high in fiber now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this
[patient] no no questions today
[doctor] okay now the other thing
[patient] how soon can i how soon will i be able to get up and get moving back outside after the surgery
[doctor] so the good news is since it's a laparoscopic procedure you're gon na be back on your feet pretty quick now for the first twenty four hours i'm gon na want you to take it pretty easy but after a couple of days if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you know we do n't want you hiking or anything like that but if you feel like moving around on some solid ground you can get up and walk around within a day or two and then in about a week or so i'll see you again and then we'll release you to go get back out there in nature
[patient] okay thank you very much
[doctor] you're very welcome the other thing i wan na talk briefly about is now your not your type two diabetes i want you to follow up with your physician just to make sure that you're handling your diabetes especially the fact that you're gon na have surgery and those type of things and we will just continue to monitor your diabetes as has been outlined by your your additional either your endocrinologist or your primary care provider i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get some paperwork signed and if you do n't have any questions for me i will see you next week and we will get this gallbladder out
[patient] well thank you very much i'm looking forward to i i do n't want anymore of that pain so
[doctor] alright that sounds good we'll see you next week then
[patient] okay take care
[doctor] yeah","

These results reveal no evidence of any significant changes in the function of the bony alignment of the lumbar spine, which is essential for successful removal of the gallbladders.
5
4 views of the abdominal wall are reviewed.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Gallstones.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with symptoms similar to gallstones.- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the nature of gallbladder disease in detail. We also discussed the risk factors for gallstones, such as high cholesterol, fatty foods, alcohol, and poor diet. I advised the patient that he should continue to limit his intake of alcohol and high-calorie foods. He was advised to avoid pork products, fruits, and spicy foods. I also advised him to reduce his exposure to MSG, MSG, and MSG-rich foods.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
 Patty’s blood glucose levels have improved since she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago, but her symptoms have not improved. We discussed that her symptoms may be related to dietary indiscretion, as well as her family history. - Medical Treatment: She will continue to follow the keto diet. She will reduce her intake of MSG and MSG, reduce her alcohol consumption, and limit her sugar intake. We will also start her on metformin 500 mg twice a day to help with her weight loss.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right shoulder sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed that his right shoulder x-ray results are consistent with a sprain of the cervical spine. We discussed the nature of this injury and that it appears to be caused by a vertebrae deformation. The patient was tackled while playing tackle football and landed awkwardly on his shoulder. He has been taking Tylenol for pain since the injury about 4 days ago. We also discussed that his symptoms do not appear to be related to any other injuries. I explained to the patient that this is not typical for this type of injury. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If he continues to have pain, I will send him a referral to an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation."
aci,ACI099,"[doctor] hi jeremy how are you the medical assistant told me that you injured your back
[patient] yeah i was moving some boxes when my son was moving out of his college dorm and i really hurt my lower back
[doctor] okay how long ago did that happen
[patient] this was about four months ago
[doctor] about four months ago okay that's quite a long time and you're just seeing me now for it
[patient] yeah the appointments were backed up and i tried some pt at my gym but it it really did n't seem to help and i was really concerned
[doctor] okay and what exactly are your symptoms are you having pain when you're just sitting there or when you're moving around for a very short period of time it felt like i was gon na tapple over i like i could n't support my my upper body weight and then my right toe or the the toes on my right foot tingled a little bit but that went away after about an hour okay are you still getting that numbing and tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone
[patient] that's completely gone it it just happened when i first felt the the tweak in my lower back i felt that sensation but i have n't since
[doctor] okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs
[patient] only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy
[doctor] okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way okay and what have you been taking for the pain
[patient] i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help
[doctor] okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol
[patient] a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time
[doctor] okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen
[patient] no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it
[doctor] okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all
[patient] i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that
[doctor] okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom
[patient] no i have n't had any of those issues
[doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any
[patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee
[doctor] okay
[patient] that went fine i rehabbed it pt has been fine it it feels about ninety five percent ever since
[doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee
[patient] it was a total knee replacement
[doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said
[patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty
[doctor] okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] now you have you had any fever or chills with this
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good
[patient] good
[doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that
[patient] no questions
[doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] any questions
[patient] not at this point
[doctor] okay great thank you
[patient] thank you","

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Martinez is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of lower back pain. The onset of his pain began 4 months ago, when he was moving some boxes when his son was moving out of his college dorm. He states that he was unable to support his upper body weight and then his right toe and the toes on his right foot tingled a little bit. This was followed by numbness and tingling in his feet for approximately 1 hour, which he attributes to the pain. He notes that he has been taking Tylenol, ibuprofen, heat, and ice, which does not provide him with relief. He denies any urinary issues, incontinence, or need to go to the bathroom. He had a total knee replacement 2 years ago in the spring of 2018.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Lower back pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis and treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with a total knee replacement in the spring of twenty twenty twenty. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review the results of the MRI. If he does not improve with continued use of ibuprofen, we will refer him to physical therapy to work on strengthening his lower back. We will also discuss the possibility of a cortisone injection to treat his sciatic nerve as well as the risk of developing a blood clot in his lower extremities.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes, hypertension, and history of asthma.


SURGICY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dennis Mitchell is a 57-year-old male presenting today for an evaluation of obstructive pulmonary disease. He reports feeling not too well for the past couple of weeks. The patient notes that he wakes up short of breath and then goes to the doctor's office, which he notes is very busy. He notes that when he leaves the clinic, he is again short of air. He adds that he has been coughing up blood for approximately 3 weeks. He denies any swelling in his legs or in his lower extremities. He states that he shaves 3 to 4 cups a day. He also denies any bruising, bleeding from his teeth, gums, or recent travel history. Denies knee swelling, but reports knee pain that has been going on for quite some time. He has not been to the hospital or emergency room as they were very busy at that time.


PHYSICAL EXAM


Neck
- General Examination: No carotid bruits.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs. No extra heart sounds.
- Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Trace lower extremity edema. No clubbing, edema, or edema in the lower extremities. No bruits in the ankles. Normal gait. No pain to palpation of the right upper extremity.

- Palpated gait: Straight leg raise with effort.


RESULTS

Hemoglobin A1c: 7.7



Rapid strep test performed today reveals no evidence of any fracture or osteoarthritis.

Echocardiogram reveals a preserved ejection fraction of 55%, abnormal diastolic filling, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild to severe sinusoidal edema.
These are normal for a 57-year-old male with a history of diabetes and high blood pressure.


These reveal no fracture or edema, which is unusual for a man of his age.


Oxygen level is within normal limits.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Shortness of breath.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is 57 years old and has a history of asthma. He presents today with a new exacerbation of his asthma. His blood pressure is also elevated with a recent echocardiogram showing a 100/80 mm Hg. His hemoglobin A1c was 7.7 last time checked, which is slightly elevated for this time of year. He is currently on metformin and Norvasc and has been compliant with this medication.

2. Diabetes type 2 A. His recent blood glucose levels have been elevated and his hemoglobin a1c has also been elevated in the past 3 weeks. He has been inconsistent with his diet and exercise in the last 3 weeks, although he claims to be doing well at this time. The patient states that his blood glucose level fluctuates between 120-140 in the morning and 200-300 in the evening. His most recent labs showed a 1.5-2.0 ng/dL glucose level in the office, but this is still within the normal range for diabetics. He also had an elevated ejection murmur on his chest x-ray, murmur murmur in"
aci,ACI029,"[doctor] alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee
[doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen
[patient] about three days ago
[doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that
[patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited
[doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging
[patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down
[doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain
[patient] anti-inflammatories
[doctor] okay alrighty and did that help
[patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now
[doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then
[patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened
[doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all
[patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal
[doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there
[patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee
[doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel
[patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end
[doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan
[patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately
[doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright i do want you to i know you are i know you actually jog often so i want you to just slow that down for a bit no jogging for a while until we get you know results of your mri till we figure out what we what we are gon na be doing okay

[doctor] thank you","
CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Scott is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of an anterior cruciate ligament tear in his right knee. The onset of his pain began approximately 3 days ago, when he was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games. He states that he was going to plank kick the ball when he felt a pop in his knee. He denies any swelling. The patient reports that his knee is swollen, but notes that some of that swelling has gone down. His pain level is approximately 4/7 out of 10. He reports that he can bend his knee with pain towards the end of the motion, but it does not feel normal. He has been taking ibuprofen for pain, which has limited his relief. He notes that he is still able to bear weight on his knee but it feels loose. He affirms that he has been unable to straighten his knee since the injury.


PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: Positive lachman exam. Neurovascularly bilateral lower extremities are intact. Musculoskeletal-wise, there is a marked limp in the right leg upon ambulation. Decreased terminal extension to about 100 and 15 degrees. Limited terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain. Pain with palpation at the medial joint line.
NEURO: Normal gait. No pain with plantarflexion or dorsiflexion. Pain without extension. Pain to palpation over the lateral aspect of the knee.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray images of the right knee taken today reveal an anterior cruciate ligament tear and bony bony alignment issues that are suggestive of a Lachman cytology study.
Impression: Significant effusion and ecchymosis in the medial joint line.
Previous anti-inflammatory medication did not seem to help the injury.
4

Previous immobilization with ibuprofen did not help.
3 days ago

4 views of the lachmann cytology are reviewed and reveal no evidence of any fracture or osteoarthritis.


ASSESSMENT

Right knee posterior cruciate ligament tear.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed an ACL tear. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with a conservative approach. First we will treat the injury conservatively. We will obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for any signs of a tear. If the MRI does not reveal a tear, we will perform a medial collateral ligament stress test on the patient to assess for possible ligament damage. If he is unable to tolerate this approach, we may consider surgical intervention such as hip replacement or a cortisone injection. The patient was advised that he will be placed into an Aircast to help strengthen his right knee. He will also be placed on meloxicam 50 mg once a day to help with his pain. He should avoid non-dominant activities for the next 4 to 6 weeks to avoid any unnecessary strain."
aci,ACI094,"[doctor] alright teresa i see here in your chart that you seem to be experiencing some elbow pain could you tell me where it hurts

[patient] no not that i recall
[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your elbow before

[doctor] okay alright so on a on a scale of one to ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain
[patient] well i'd say it's about a seven
[doctor] wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night
[patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up
[doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain
[patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping
[doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else
[patient] i tried a little bit of ice at first
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now
[doctor] okay
[patient] did n't getting better
[doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse
[patient] well it's just not getting better
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly
[patient] yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties
[doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday
[patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril
[doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly
[patient] well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it
[doctor] okay
[patient] and plus i kinda have a sweet tooth so you know sometimes they're a little bit higher you know like one fifty to one seventy so
[doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there
[patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that
[doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations
[patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy
[doctor] okay
[patient] simpon rolls i got that recipe out of a southern living magazine
[doctor] oof
[patient] a long time ago and
[doctor] so you know it's good
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage
[patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it
[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
[patient] had some friends tell me something about that
[doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right
[patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too
[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] checked it in a while so
[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily
[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks
[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day
[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow
[patient] it's my right
[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside
[patient] yes it does
[doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain
[patient] no not really
[doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so
[patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far
[doctor] absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that
[patient] i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look
[doctor] your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i
[patient] okay
[doctor] do you
[patient] just true
[doctor] yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of fracture. We discussed the nature of her injuries, as well as her history of lisinopril use, and that she is currently on 5 mg of metformin twice a day. She is also a potter and has been working on a ceramic bowl for her son's birthday. I advised her that for this occasion, I want her to paint it and decorate it and have to do some real full decorations.

[doctor] well let me so we're gon na have to watch that and i'll come back and we'll talk a little bit about the diabetes but let's go ahead and do that i do n't wan na do a a a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na look in your eyes here and so let me quickly look in your ears
[patient] i see
[doctor] okay that looks good and any let me let me listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and your heart it's a regular rate and rhythm that's all good as we go through that now i want you to sit up here i'm gon na press down your back starting at the top and any pain up top no
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and then once i get down here and around that low back i wan na press in the center first does that cause you a lot of pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay
[patient] yeah that that's the spot
[doctor] okay and if i come over here to the right no
[patient] not that much you know
[doctor] okay so and then on the left hand side if i push down here kind of into your butt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] lay back on the stretcher for me for a second i'm gon na go ahead and and lift your legs for me or i'm gon na go ahead and lift your legs for you just relax i'm gon na start here on the right side when i lift that right leg up does that cause you significant pain or any pain at all
[patient] a little a little bit
[doctor] okay let me come around let me lift up the left side if i lift that up does that cause
[patient] yeah yeah yeah that's that's
[doctor] yeah
[patient] still get tender yeah
[doctor] i can see that gritts on your face so okay that's good and you know as i look at your lower extremities there is no pain or numbness or tingling in your feet or anything like that
[patient] hmmm no
[doctor] okay okay so lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan so for that low back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me
[patient] yeah can i still go to the bakery
[doctor] i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that
[patient] right and how soon should i you know check my blood sugars i mean what's a good you know
[doctor] yeah i that's a great question i'm really glad you asked that i would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure every morning the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning that's gon na give me a good idea and so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it you know i know your glucometer keeps a record of it but if you can write them down and once we get that a1c that's gon na give me a little more guidance on how to deal with your blood your diabetes
[patient] right do you think would i need to see you know a pain doctor or you know
[doctor] not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay thank you i'm gon na send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door
[patient] thank you

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Noah Smith is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The patient has had back pain for approximately 1 week. He does not remember an injury. He states he twisted his left arm one day and thought that was the end of the pain, however, after a few hours it has been there since then. He has tried various over-the-counter medications but they do not provide relief. The pain radiates across the whole low back and into the left side of the left arm. He believes the pain is localized right in the middle of the back and towards the lower back, but he sometimes experiences it going back to the left eye. He is taking metformin twice a day and states he tries to control his sugar with exercise.


PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Alert and oriented x3. Speech is clear and fluent. Gait is steady. Heel toe walking is normal. Cranial nerves grossly intact without focal neurologic findings. No pronator drift.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.


Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Pain to palpation of the back, mainly across the little back and on the left. Right upper quadrant is slightly distended.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray images of the chest were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of any fracture or osteoarthritis. There is development of mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, which is normal for someone in their early 40s. No evidence of fracture or arthritis is noted.
4

4 views of the diastolic filling were also obtained. These are unremarkable.
5 views are not abnormal.
6 views are located in the center of the back across the whole low back and across the little back and on the left side.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Low back pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. We discussed the nature of his history of diabetes and that he should continue to monitor his blood sugar daily. He will continue to take metformin twice a day. We also discussed that his family owns the bakery on the corner of Main Street and I want him to stay away from that bakery. I also advised him to avoid the bakery's cakes and donuts as they are unhealthy for his diabetes.
"
aci,ACI089,"[patient] i hope i did n't hurt it again
[doctor] hi gregory how are you i the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee
[patient] yeah yeah i heard it stepping off a curb
[doctor] how long ago did that happen
[patient] about two and a half weeks ago
[doctor] two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you
[patient] the right knee the outside of my right knee
[doctor] the outside of your right knee
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or
[patient] no i just sorta turned over my ankle
[doctor] okay
[patient] to the outside and i thought my ankle was the thing that was gon na hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when i walk
[doctor] and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk
[patient] no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall
[doctor] okay
[patient] then i feel like it's locked and then i sort of have to ease into walking again
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] really nothing
[doctor] okay
[patient] ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and
[doctor] does the ibuprofen work
[patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better
[doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there
[patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel
[doctor] okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that
[patient] a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type
[doctor] okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to
[patient] no i ride the bike
[doctor] okay
[patient] i ride the bike i ride the bike which i'm not doing now peloton inside for the winter i do have a winter bike though
[doctor] okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor
[patient] i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides
[doctor] okay what kind of rides do you like
[patient] i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with
[doctor] i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear
[doctor] okay when did you break your toe
[patient] i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury
[doctor] okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new
[patient] right correct
[doctor] alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee
[patient] no not physically
[doctor] okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt
[patient] only when you pull it to the outside
[doctor] okay
[patient] from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts
[doctor] okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home
[patient] yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day
[doctor] okay and so does that help at all
[patient] it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much
[doctor] okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots
[patient] and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse
[doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything
[patient] i will
[doctor] okay bye
[patient] bye","

Right knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Taylor is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of his pain began 2 and a half weeks ago, when he heard his right knee locking up. He sustained the injury while stepping off of a curb. He denies he fell down; however, he did turn over his ankle, which initially caused his ankle to hurt most. After the initial ankle soreness resolved, he noticed his knee clicking when he walked. He states that his knee clicks when he walks, but denies it when he is resting or sitting. His pain is localized to the outside of the right knee and does not extend to the inside of the knee. The patient states that he is able to perform basic exercises such as squats and catcalls without pain, but notes that it is the full squat that causes him to feel the most clicking. He notes that the clicking is the most noticeable at the moment of full squatting. At night he takes ibuprofen, which he believes helps him to settle down and sleep better. He also reports numbing and t

aci,ACI105,"[doctor] hi dennis how are you today
[patient] good
[doctor] so what what brings you into the office i do n't believe i have ever seen you before here
[patient] the i'm training for a triathlon and the back of my heel hurts typically after a workout or when i first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the back of my heel all the way up into my calf
[doctor] okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training what do you are you are you running far are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today
[patient] i i will run about ten klometers
[doctor] okay
[patient] in the morning at lunchtime i try to get on the bike for about forty five minutes to an hour
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then in the evening i go to the aquatic center and i jump in the pool and swim for about another thirty minutes to an hour
[doctor] wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training
[patient] i i do that five days a week on the weekends i kinda alternate between you know a long run and a long bike do n't really do a long swim but
[doctor] okay
[patient] i i just swimming on those other five days and i take one day off
[doctor] okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both
[patient] yeah i do n't i do n't stretch at all i do n't have time for that
[doctor] okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah you know i you know when i first start off i go slow until i'm warmed up and then i
[doctor] okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also
[patient] yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again
[doctor] okay
[patient] or
[doctor] no go ahead go ahead
[patient] or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too
[doctor] okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right
[patient] no it's mainly just on the right
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that
[patient] yeah a little bit
[doctor] a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt
[patient] yeah that hurts a little bit too
[doctor] yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] no
[doctor] and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt
[patient] that's real tender
[doctor] yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night
[patient] no i i was watching the track meet
[doctor] my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here

He reports that he runs about 10 miles on the weekend and alternate between a long bike and a long run. He does not stretch his lower extremities with either the bicycle or the running.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left heel pain and right calf tightness. Denies right ankle pain.


PHYSICAL EXAM


MSK: Examination of the right heel: No pain to palpation of the medial aspect of the heel.

Neurological
- Assessment of the Left Lower extremity: Mild dorsiflexion of the left lower extremity. Pain with palpation. No pain with flexion, extension, or extension of the lower extremities. Positive Hernon's Symptomus. Negative Erythema of the Right Thrombosis of the L5 and L6 Tonsils.

objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray of the left calf is reviewed and revealed no evidence of any fracture or osteoarthritis. There is development of mild bony alignment issues, especially on the right side of the right heel, which is unusual for a triathlon. These tend to be limited to the anterior aspect of the lisfranc muscle. These are normal and do not develop into acute arthritis. These may be reversible with time and proper application of icing and supportive supportive braces.


These are not considered to be in good position.
Impression: progressive arthritis is present.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right heel tendinitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his training for a triathlon. I have explained to him that his symptoms appear to be related to his right heel tendons. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis and treatment options for this. He will continue to follow up with me in 2 weeks for further evaluation. If his symptoms do not improve with continued treatment, we will consider a cortisone injection or surgical intervention. If he continues to have pain, we may need to consider further imaging such as a stress fracture or a fracture of the right heel.
"
aci,ACI007,"[doctor] so hey christina good to see you today i see you're here you have a nonhealing foot ulcer well also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on
[patient] doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal
[doctor] okay how long has that wound been present
[patient] maybe about a year
[doctor] a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden
[patient] no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i went on some antibiotics it seemed to get better but nothing is really making it go away
[doctor] okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics
[patient] it's probably been five months
[doctor] five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on
[patient] keflex
[doctor] keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the
[patient] no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot
[doctor] alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it
[patient] lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired
[doctor] okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend
[patient] not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do
[doctor] no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running
[patient] yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten
[doctor] okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but
[patient] yes
[doctor] you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the
[patient] yes i think so
[doctor] okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes
[patient] i've just been wearing my regular shoes
[doctor] okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me
[patient] i do n't think so
[doctor] alright so i'll see you back in two weeks and i hope you have fun at the zoo this weekend
[patient] thank you

She was seen by her primary care physician, who prescribed antibiotics, but nothing really improved the symptoms. The patient notes that she has been on antibiotics for approximately 5 months, but they do not seem to be making her feel any better. She denies any fever, chills, or drainage. She states that she feels more tired recently. She has type 2 diabetes and reports that her blood sugars are still in the 2,000s, but her last a1c was about 10. She plans to spend the weekend eating out and not doing anything as her doctor would not be excited about her doing that due to her diabetes.


PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Normal gait.
- Examination of the right foot: There is a 1.5 cm 2in circular wound in the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot proximal to the 5mTP joint. Yellow slough is present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No evidence of fluid collection. No odour.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of the foot: No bony exposure, no odor, and no drainage from the wound. No osteomyelitis.


RESULTS

X-rays of the right foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.

4 views of the foot were taken. These show well-maintained tissue with minimal granulation tissue. There is no clear evidence of erythema or cellulitis, and the skin is free of any bony exposure.


4 view of the left foot was also reviewed today and shows no osteoarthritis or bony infection.

Electrocardiogram demonstrates good bony conduction.
3 views are obtained.
These reveal well-developed bony arrangement.


ASSESSMENT

Right foot nonhealing ulcer.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her ulcer does not appear to be healing and that this is likely due to her type 2 diabetes. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we start her on antibiotics. The last time she was on antibiotics was 5 months ago. She will follow up with me in 1 month to check on her progress. If her symptoms do not improve with the antibiotics, we may consider performing a CT or MRI of the right foot to evaluate for possible osteomyelitis. The patient would like to avoid going out for the weekend as this would expose her to the elements.
INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow-up with the doctor on Thursday."
aci,ACI022,"[doctor] alright julia so you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an rca stent placed back in twenty eighteen but i see you're here for follow-up after an interior stemi where we had to put in another stent right so like how are you doing
[patient] well i mean it was a real shock for me i thought everything was fine after my last heart attack and then i just started having this horrible chest pain and it would n't go away so i went to the emergency room and yeah they told me i needed another stent
[doctor] wow so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time
[patient] yeah yeah it was yeah it was bad it was just like the last time
[doctor] okay have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath
[patient] no i think i saw you about six months ago and and i was doing fine
[doctor] okay have you been able to like exercise at all since since you last saw me
[patient] yeah you know i walk my dog everyday and you know we go like a mile and a half or two miles

[doctor] do you have any like plans for the holiday
[patient] no mm-hmm no i'm just you know looking forward to seeing family and having some nice weather and yeah
[doctor] okay so i do wan na ask i know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes so i wan na get an idea of like where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling
[patient] i have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital
[doctor] okay are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep
[patient] yeah i mean i always use a couple of pillows you know i maybe i've had to sit up a little bit more but i mean for the most part i think it's pretty normal
[doctor] okay and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like your like you were prescribed
[patient] yeah i'm able to afford afford them i have good insurance i am taking them they told me it's really important to take them so so yeah
[doctor] yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake
[patient] i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i love pizza it's my favorite food
[doctor] yeah
[patient] my tries are probably my second favorite food
[doctor] what are you for her toppings on pizza
[patient] pepperoni occasionally vegetables
[doctor] mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right
[patient] i know i know i'm gon na work on it
[doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well
[patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active
[doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you
[doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright thank you","
CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up after an interior stemi.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Julia Diaz is a pleasant 53-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for follow-up of an interior stent placement. The patient was last seen approximately 6 months ago, when she began experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. She initially thought everything was normal after her last ejection murmur. She was sent to the emergency room by mistake and was told she needed another stent. Today, she reports experiencing similar symptoms similar to the first time that she was there. She denies chest pain or dyspnea on exertion. She has a history of hypertension and diabetes. She is taking metformin and is trying to stay active. Her legs have been a little swollen since she was sent home from the hospital. She states that she is able to lie flat at night, but needs to use a couple of pillows.


MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and nephritis.


PHYSICAL EXAM


Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Stable 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.


Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Mild ecchymosis in the lower extremities. No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
- Palpation: Mild edema in the right lower extremity.

- Sensation: Tender to palpation of the right upper quadrant.


RESULTS

Electrocardiogram is reviewed and revealed a preserved ejection fraction of 55%, abnormal diastolic filling, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.

Echocardiogram reveals a left ventricular hypertrophy, which is unusual for his age and type of heart attack.


Lipid panel reveals a preserved sinus rhythm, with good R wave progression and evolutionary changes, and is in good position to progress to the next stage.


4 views of the coronary artery disease are reviewed and reveal no evidence of atherosclerotic aneurysm.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's cardiac exam today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are similar to her previous heart attack. We discussed that she will have to watch her diet as well as her salt intake. I advised her that she may have to go back to watching the salt intake as she has been less strict with her diet since her last visit. I also advised her to monitor her blood glucose levels daily and continue taking metformin. She should also continue to use a couple of pillows when she sleeps to help support her back when she is lying down.
2. Congestive heart failure

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review her findings and discuss further treatment options."
aci,ACI034,"[doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on
[patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay
[doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta
[patient] yes and and fish oil
[doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that
[patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy
[doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so
[patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents
[doctor] yep
[patient] how long do i have to have that in there
[doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging
[patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then
[doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time
[patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to
[doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies
[patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty
[doctor] okay
[patient] fasting
[doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking
[patient] i thought it was close to sixty
[doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet
[patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results
[doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist
[patient] oh
[doctor] that's your kidney doctor
[patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago
[doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil
[patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out
[doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span
[patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan
[doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again
[patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches
[doctor] you can take tylenol
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah
[patient] alright that sounds good
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications
[doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause
[patient] yeah i do have that
[doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay for your
[patient] sounds really good
[doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions
[patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad
[doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others
[patient] no no i just feel kinda down
[doctor] you feel kinda down what's your
[patient] life sucks
[doctor] what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like
[patient] you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely
[doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out
[patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time
[doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay

CHIEF COMPLAINT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joseph Martinez is a 76-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a patient with coronary artery disease. The patient sustained a left anterior descending artery disease approximately 6 months ago. He underwent surgery to install a stent in his left coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin, Brilinta, fish oil, and statin. He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath. His only complaint is dizziness.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he is doing well, but he is concerned with his medications. He notes that he has been taking a fair amount of medications as he did have a heart attack. He adds that he does not know if this is the result of the medications he is taking or not. He also notes that when he stands up really fast he gets really dizzy.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fever, chills, or changes in appetite. Denies changes in weight.
Cardiovascular: Denied chest pain.
Genitourinary: Reports kidney function stable.
Musculoskeletal: Reports muscle ac
PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Examination of Heart: Stent has been installed in the left anterior descending artery. The stent is permanent. The patient is taking aspirin and brilinta for another 6 months to prevent the stent from clogging.
- Diabetes
- Monitoring the pancreas: Glucose is coming in at 1/6 the normal level. The pancreatic ejection murmur is low.


VITALS REVIEWED

- Baselized Heart: No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray images of the left anterior descending artery were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal good bony alignment and no evidence of coronary artery disease.
Impression: stable hemoglobin A1c is reviewed at 7.3.


Electrocardiogram reveals normal sinus rhythm with good R wave progression and evolutionary changes, which are anticipated.


Previous heart attack was probably due to mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic progression.
Peripheral artery disease is preventable with proper management.


ASSESSMENT

1. Coronary artery disease.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's medical history, symptoms, and medications today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current medications. I have recommended that he continue taking aspirin, Brilinta, statin, and fish oil. We discussed that it is important for him to continue on these medications. We also discussed that he should continue to watch his diet, watch his cholesterol levels, and watch his intake of alcohol. I also advised him to follow up with the dietitian as I believe his diabetes probably contributed to his heart attack. I will send in a referral for diabetic education for him.
2. Stents

The patient had a heart attack about 6 months ago. The stents were placed in his left anterior descending artery. They are permanent and will remain that way for the rest of his life. The patient will continue to take aspirin, brilintas, and statin 50 mg once a day. He will also continue taking metoprolol 50 mg twice a day for another 6 months to help prevent clogging of the stents.
3. Diabetes

I have advised the patient to"
aci,ACI065,"[doctor] yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on
[patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i think it's been but lately
[doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what
[patient] it's gradually increasing for sure
[doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea
[patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week
[doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times
[patient] a couple of times
[doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that's
[patient] and the venti
[doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking
[patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup
[doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it
[patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen
[doctor] hmmm okay
[patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy
[doctor] okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it
[patient] i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so
[doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct
[patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so
[doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing
[patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease
[doctor] yep okay
[patient] i think that's a good decision though
[doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions
[patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] lately that could be contributing towards my gastritis so i'm gon na cut back on that as well
[doctor] okay yeah i'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices the spicy food easier said than done sometimes i know but yep yep alright sounds good well listen i'll see you back in four weeks give me a holler if if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime
[patient] i will
[doctor] alright you take care sure you got","

aci,ACI079,"[doctor] good afternoon alexis i understand you're having some issues with your hand
[patient] yes i sit at the keyboard all day long and recently i've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand
[doctor] okay how long has that been going on
[patient] i do n't know probably on and off for six months but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent
[doctor] okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question
[patient] some pain
[doctor] some pain
[patient] mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain
[doctor] okay
[patient] but the numbness and tingling is all the time now
[doctor] okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other
[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most
[doctor] okay
[patient] the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse
[doctor] your mouth okay
[patient] wow
[doctor] yeah when you're moving that around okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay
[patient] not affecting my sleep hmmm
[doctor] okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand
[patient] mostly my right hand
[doctor] mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand
[patient] yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with
[doctor] okay
[patient] not why that is
[doctor] okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
[patient] i was afraid of
[doctor] yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
[patient] okay
[doctor] we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
[patient] that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
[doctor] yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions
[patient] no that's great thank you so much
[doctor] thank you very much","
CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-hand numbness and tingling in right hand.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alexis Martinez is a pleasant 31-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right-hand pain. The onset of her pain has been intermittent on and off for the past 6 months but has become more persistent over the last month or so. She reports that she experiences the pain mostly when she is typing on the keyboard. The patient notes that she has been taking ibuprofen for pain. She denies that her pain ever wakes her up in the middle of the night.

Respiratory
- Auscultation: Lungs are clear and clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray of the right hand is reviewed and shows positive tingling and bony alignment with good bony mobility.


Impression: Torralde-related achondroplasty with good R2-mannia progression is present.
4 views are obtained. These reveal no evidence of any fracture or arthritis. There is development of mild-to-moderate arthritis in the lateral aspect of the wrist which is consistent with a carpal tunnel syndrome.
5 views are anticipated.
6 views reveal some bony detachment of the acetabulum which is normal.


ASSESSMENT

Right hand carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. We discussed the possibility of performing an MRI of the right wrist to evaluate for possible bunion formation. The patient was advised that this procedure would be performed in an outpatient setting. He was also advised that he will need to continue taking ibuprofen 600 mg 4 times a day. At night he will be placed into a wrist splint.

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed no fracture. We discussed that he will continue to wear a crutcher to keep his right ankle elevated when he is seated. He will also be placed into an Aircast to provide additional support for the ankle. At this time, he will remain non-weight-bearing for 1 to 2 days. I advised him to continue taking NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

New patient evaluation of newly diagnosed hypercholesterolemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jade Cruz is a pleasant 17-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of hypothyroidism. The patient was last seen by her primary care physician for her annual checkup, however, her cholesterol was elevated and she was referred to see the clinic by mistake. She is concerned with her elevated cholesterol levels. She states that she is worried about this finding because she was told to watch what she was eating at the time of her annual visit, but denies any issues with growing up. She reports that she tries to eat a pretty clean diet most days and enjoys chocolate chip cookies. She also enjoys riding her bicycle a lot. She went for a bike ride over the weekend with some friends and they had a pick at the morning, which was fun. She decided about 2 years ago that she no longer felt like a girl and that she does not feel much like a girly-person anymore.

Previous cholesterol tests were reviewed and revealed no evidence of any serious heart disease or osteoarthritis.


Previous hemoglobin A1c is reviewed at 7.3, which is within normal limits. endorsing: Maintaining normal levels is normal, but may be improved with exercise and good quality of lifestyle, as noted in the review.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Hypercholesterolemia.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and results today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current elevated cholesterol levels. I have explained to her that this is normal for her age and that she should continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle. We discussed that her cholesterol levels may be related to her diet and exercise. I advised her to continue to watch her intake of cholesterol-lowering foods such as chocolate chip cookies. We also discussed the importance of setting health goals and making sure that I feel healthy. I also advised her that she can smoke or live with her parents or friends who smoke to avoid the risk of developing heart disease. She is encouraged to stop smoking and is advised to contact her parents if she smokes. I encouraged her to contact me if she sees an increase in her cholesterol. We will try to look for a referral to a cardiologist to discuss further treatment options.

[patient] i do n't know every time i start walking i'm just having this kind of pressure and chest pain in my chest
[doctor] okay are you having it now or is it gone right now
[patient] right now it's not there
[doctor] okay and how long have you been having this
[patient] probably maybe three months
[doctor] okay and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it
[patient] it mainly happens when i'm walking i like to try and walk but lately i just have n't been able to keep up with it because i'm having this pain
[doctor] alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it
[patient] i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure
[doctor] okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now
[patient] nothing right now
[doctor] okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going
[patient] yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose
[doctor] yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you
[patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting
[doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that
[patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure
[doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years
[patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain
[doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so
[patient] someone had told me before
[doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that
[patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill
[doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not
[patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away
[doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea
[patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication
[doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright any other questions we got
[patient] that's it
[doctor] alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today
[patient] thank you appreciate it","
CHIEF COMPLAINT

Cardiovascular disease.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure. She is currently on metformin and was referred to this clinic from several other clinics where her blood pressure was elevated. She states that her blood sugars have been a little higher because she has not been active and she is trying with diet coke. She denies any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any side effects from her medications.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fever, chills, or changes in appetite. Denies changes in bowel movements.
Gastrointestinal: Denied abdominal pain, or dysphagia.
Genitourinary: Reports urinary incontinence.
Musculoskeletal: Reports dull chest pain. Den denies shortness of breath or clamminess.


PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Alert and oriented x3. Speech is clear and fluent. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Grade 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from prior exam. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.


Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Dull pain in the chest. Pain to palpation of the bilateral lower extremities. No carotid bruits.
- Palpation: Mild.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray of the chest was reviewed today and shows no evidence of a heart attack or any other serious medical condition.
Previous echocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with good R wave progression and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, which is unusual for a 53-year-old woman.


Previous hemoglobin A1c of 7.3 is reviewed and is normal for a diastolic blood pressure of 45/40 mm HbA1c and is reviewed with good prognosis, as reviewed in the office today.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Chest pain.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with chest pain consistent with high blood pressure. Her echocardiogram did not reveal any signs of a heart attack or anything like that, but she does have elevated blood pressure and is currently on metformin. Her hemoglobin A1c was 7.2 at the time of her ekg, which is slightly elevated. We discussed the possibility of sending her to ophthalmology for an eye exam, which she had not seen in the last few months or years, as well as her diabetes. She will also be referred to cardiology for a chest x-ray.

2. High blood pressure, likely due to dietary indiscretion and poor exercise habits.
 - Medical Treatment: We will start her on albuterol 500 mg twice a day for 2 weeks to see if that helps reduce her pressure. We will also order a blood pressure cuff and arterial ultrasound to monitor for any elevation of the blood vessels in her chest. She may also need to start some medications, such as aspirin, to keep her blood pressure under control."
aci,ACI106,"[doctor] hey sophia how are you doing today
[patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you because of this knee pain that i've been having for about six months now
[doctor] okay do you remember what caused the pain initially
[patient] you know i really ca n't recall any specific event that caused the pain
[doctor] alright well can can you describe the pain for me
[patient] yeah so it's it's like a deep achy pain that it i feel like it's behind my kneecaps and sometimes i can even hear like what seems like like some creaking in my knees
[doctor] hmmm alright now tell me what what type of activities makes that pain worse
[patient] so i feel like the pain gets worse anytime i'm like getting from like a seated position to standing so i i work from home so i'm at my desk a lot so anytime i get up i have some pain or after watching tv or even like going up and down stairs it's really painful
[doctor] hmmm okay and does anything make the pain feel better
[patient] usually after i rest it for some time it does help with the pain
[doctor] okay now you did mention earlier that you have tried some things in the past can you tell me what they were
[patient] yeah so when it first started hurting i was putting ice on it and i even got like some ace bandage like wrapping from the pharmacy i do take ibuprofen or aleve sometimes but i try to avoid really taking any medications
[doctor] okay and and tell me what is your day like
[patient] well i try to be as active as i can i actually love to run and i would run like five to six miles a day but now i i mean honestly i ca n't even get to half a mile and my leg will start hurting my knee will start hurting
[doctor] okay that's definitely a decrease in your mileage there where have you been running lately like do you run outside or on a treadmill or
[patient] yeah i i you know i will do the treadmill during the winter but i just love being outdoors and running
[doctor] yeah yeah there are some really nice senior routes here in boston is n't there like
[patient] there are
[doctor] so many knee places there's some right by the harbor that i've i've done some runs there before too it's pretty nice well i mean the boston marathon what can you say right
[patient] right exactly exactly no it's very nice
[doctor] well okay well hopefully that we get you feeling better so you can start running again more than . five miles but tell me though have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before
[patient] no i've been pretty good i actually have never broken a bone actually no i'm gon na change that actually i did break my arm when i was in sixth grade but nothing since then
[doctor] okay
[patient] i
[doctor] okay and it's just your arm right not not your knee
[patient] right
[doctor] okay well alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here let me look at your vital signs okay i reviewed your vitals they they overall they look good take a listen to your heart real quick alright and your heart exam i hear regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs and on your musculoskeletal exam i have seen you and walk around here and you do have normal gait alright now i'm gon na have you do some movements on your legs here okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five so that's good let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam there is no overlying erythema that's redness or ecchymosis and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated there is no effusion let me go ahead and feel around here does that hurt right here how does that feel
[patient] it does
[doctor] sorry so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinacular retinaculum and there is positive patellar grind test alright and can you are you able to squat for me
[patient] i can but that hurts
[doctor] okay alright so you're definitely having some knee pain with squatting and i'm just gon na maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick okay so lachman anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray tests are all negative bilaterally so that's good there okay now your neuro exam patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so now i did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your mri your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people so this condition has to do with the way your kneecap which is your patella how that moves along the groove of your thigh your thigh bone which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain but i'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have so do you have any questions for me about that
[patient] will i be able to run anytime soon
[doctor] well that is a goal of treatment and to get you back in running again now you will have to take an take it easy from running for now but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright anything else
[patient] no i think that's it
[doctor] okay well very good well i will be following up with you soon and again just take it easy for now from the running okay
[patient] okay thank you

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed no evidence of a fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with conservative treatment in the form of icing and anti-inflammatory injections. We also discussed the importance of activity and that she should continue to limit her running activity. She should limit her distance to 5 to 6 miles per day and avoid running while she is at work. Additionally, I advised her to monitor her weight daily and keep an eye on her weight. She will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on her progress.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Kyle Taylor is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The onset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, when he felt a pop in his lower back while lifting a box of books. He denies using proper lifting technique at the time of the injury. The pain did not initially radiate down his left leg, but now it is starting to do so. He describes his pain as achy and sharp. The patient states that he tries to exercise a few times a week but is inconsistent as he has a sedentary job. He does not report any numbness or tingling associated with his pain, nor does he experience any loss of control of his bladder or bowels. He has a family history of spine pain, his father has a back pain, and he does not smoke. He notes that he has tried taking ibuprofen and Tylenol, which sometimes help. He declines to discuss the possibility of surgery with the doctor.

ASSESSMENT

Lumbar spine pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. We discussed that this is a common issue for patients with low back pain and that treatment options are limited due to their limited mobility. We also discussed that pain can be unpredictable and that it may be caused by a variety of factors including stress, diet, exercise, and the inability to properly engage in self-care. The patient was encouraged to discontinue all non-steroid NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, at this time. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress."

[patient] yeah
[doctor] that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg
[patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago
[doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts
[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside
[doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it
[patient] yeah i did
[doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten
[patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah
[doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that
[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all
[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen
[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol
[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again
[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely
[patient] right
[doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt
[patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound
[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that
[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days

She rates her pain level as 4 out of 10 but it is getting worse and it is starting to throbbing. The patient reports that she has been taking Tylenol, which does help a little bit, but it has a time limit so she is not supposed to take more than every 4 hours.

ASSESSMENT

Left knee strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a medial collateral ligament strain. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of Tylenol 500 mg once a day for pain and anti-inflammatory. She will also be placed in an Aircast to help strengthen her left knee. I advised her to avoid running for the next 2 weeks to allow her knee to heal. I also advised her not to take any ibuprofen over-the-counter as it will mess up her liver. The patient will follow up with me in 1 week to check on her progress."
