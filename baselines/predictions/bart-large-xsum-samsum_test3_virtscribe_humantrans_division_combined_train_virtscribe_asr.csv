virtscribe,VS022,"[doctor] patient mrn : abc123 . date of birth : january 1st , 1960 . patient is a 60 year old , right-handed male , referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling .
[doctor] hello , mr. cook . how are you doing this morning ?
[patient] hi , dr. martinez . this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now .
[doctor] so it's in both of your hands ?
[patient] yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .
[doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ?
[patient] no , i also wear the left sometimes . the right is just worse , but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .
[doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ?
[patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .
[doctor] i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?
[patient] eh , it's mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .
[doctor] and when do you feel these symptoms ?
[patient] well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .
[doctor] okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?
[patient] like , feeling something ? no , not that i can really think of . though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .
[doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ?
[patient] yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet .
[doctor] and no history of thyroid issues , correct ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] all right , thank you , mr. cook . okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems . correct me if i'm wrong in any of this .
[doctor] constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain . and the remainder of the review of systems is negative .
[patient] yep , that's all correct .
[doctor] all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ?
[patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .
[doctor] sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right .
[doctor] and how about on the left ?
[patient] um , yeah , but these two a little less .
[doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left
[doctor] okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally .
[doctor] all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ?
[patient] yeah , it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too .
[doctor] and how about the left side ?
[patient] yeah , same on that side too .
[doctor] tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal .
[doctor] all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me .
[patient] okay , so how do we make it better ?
[doctor] first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues .
[patient] that sounds fine to me .
[doctor] great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery . you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment .
[patient] sounds good , doc .
[doctor] all right , keep wearing your splints , and i will see you after those studies .
[patient] thank you .","

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Bilateral hand numbness and tingling.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Taylor is a 60-year-old right-handed female new patient referred by Dr. Lopez for evaluation of bilateral hand tingle and numbness. She sustained a car accident last December. She fractured her right wrist and left wrist in the accident. She is wearing a splint on the right wrist, but she notes that the left wrist is getting worse. She experiences numbness in both hands ever since she broke them. She states that she has had this numbness for a few weeks. The numbness is mainly on right side of her right hand, from the middle finger all the way up to her forearm, and on left side more the pinky and the ring finger, and less the middle and the middle of the left middle finger. There is no loss of sensation in her hands or fingers. The pain is mainly at night and throughout the day, but overall they feel weaker, especially when she is using them. When she is not using them, they throb and feel weaker. She reports mild stiffness in her neck, probably due to the impact of hitting her head during the accident
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Physical Examination

Constitutional
Gastrointestinal
Excess appetite, bloating, and gallops.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.
Brain scan performed on 2/5/21 revealed no significant changes.
Impression: No acute intercranial abnormalities.

X-ray images of the bilateral hands were reviewed and reviewed on the same day as the review of the ct brain with and without contrasting.
Abdominal x-ray is unremarkable.
Echocardiogram is normal.

Lipid panel is in good position.
Patient is allergic to sulfa drugs.
Chronic kidney disease, gout, hypertension and anxiety.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Bilateral hand numbness and tingling.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with symptoms similar to carpal tunnel syndrome. She is a 60-year-old right-handed female new patient referred by dr. jacob ward for evaluation. I reviewed her CT results with and without contrast on 2/5/21. There is no evidence of any malignancy or other malignancies at this time. I recommended that the patient follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess her bilateral bilateral wrists. We discussed the possibility of epidural neuromuscular stenosis, bilaterally symmetrical bilateral wrists, and possible bilateral bunion nodules. I also advised her to discontinue oxycodone 25 mg 2 times a day for hypertension and lexapro 10 mg daily for anxiety, as well as avoid gout and sulfa, as she is allergic to both.

Patient Agreements: She understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

virtscribe,VS012,"[doctor] michelle king , date of birth 01/05/1986 , mrnq27631 . new patient visit for acid reflux . past medical history of anxiety and seasonal allergies .
[doctor] hello , are you mrs. king ?
[patient] i am .
[doctor] i'm dr. phillips . very nice to meet you .
[patient] you as well .
[doctor] how can i help you today ?
[patient] well , my primary doctor , dr. scott , he referred me here .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've just got really bad acid reflux .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me more about it ?
[patient] yeah . though i mean i ... right now , i take 40 milligrams of omeprazole twice a day . some days , it is fine , but others are just really bad .
[doctor] what do you feel ?
[patient] it feels like burning .
[doctor] in your chest ?
[patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat .
[doctor] in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?
[patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?
[patient] on the way , it is now i think about a year .
[doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?
[patient] i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .
[doctor] are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?
[patient] sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .
[doctor] okay . what things bother you ?
[patient] spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .
[doctor] we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?
[patient] yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .
[doctor] okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?
[patient] i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .
[doctor] what do you do for work ?
[patient] i'm a paralegal .
[doctor] okay . and any family history of gi issues ?
[patient] um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .
[doctor] on your mom or dad's side ?
[patient] mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .
[doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?
[patient] i think maybe when i was younger .
[doctor] but not in the last 10 years ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?
[patient] um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .
[doctor] okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?
[patient] i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .
[doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .
[patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .
[doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .
[patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .
[doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .
[patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .
[doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .
[patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?
[doctor] yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .
[doctor] please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","

virtscribe,VS018,"[doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05/07/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06/29/2021 , and was discharged on 07/02/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ?
[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?
[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?
[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?
[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .
[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , "" no , "" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .
[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .
[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?
[doctor] typically , it does n't .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .
[patient] yeah , that's what they said .
[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...
[patient] hm .
[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?
[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .
[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .
[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .
[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?
[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .
[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?
[patient] sure , i can do that .
[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .
[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .
[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .
[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?
[doctor] yes .
[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .
[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?
[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .
[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?
[patient] i am unvaccinated .
[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?
[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .
[doctor] correct , we do n't .
[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as "" vaccine injury "" .
[doctor] right .
[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .
[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .
[patient] all of them ?
[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?
[patient] no , i do n't .
[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .
[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .
[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .
[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .
[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .
[patient] thanks , you too .
[doctor] next line heading will be "" acute to chronic constipation "" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis .
[doctor] i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be "" quadriplegia "" . um , next line and heading will be "" covid vaccine status "" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good discussion , and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid . however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .","
CHIEF COMPLAINT

Urinary tract infection.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 39-year-old female with a history of quadriplegia due to a prior spinal cord injury. She presents today to follow up regarding her concerns regarding significant constipation, febrile state, significant spasms, lightheadedness, significant headaches, and reported diaphoresis. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and was discharged on 07/02/2020. There were concerns for an ongoing urinary tract infection at the time of her admission, but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy and slowly improved. She has a supra-pubic catheter and was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms. She believes that her constipation was the cause of her blood pressure being so high. She states that she hardly pooped when she was there, but felt much better after she got home and had a massive poop. She denies undergoing a CAT scan at the emergency department. She explains that she told them that her phone listens to both her and the doctor and it does all of her documentation.

Urinal tract infection was not identified.
Abdominal x-rays did not reveal any abnormalities.
Echocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm.
Rapid strep test was performed and reviewed. No abnormalities were noted.
Urine cultures were obtained. No significant changes were noted in the cultures.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to prior spinal cord injury. She presents today to follow up regarding her symptoms.

Urine culture revealed an ongoing urinary tract infection.
• Medical Reasoning: She was admitted to the emergency department on 06/29/2020. She was treated with iv antibiotic therapy and was discharged on 07/02/2021. Her white blood cell count was significantly elevated at 23,000, but she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement. She had a massive poop at home, which boded well for her to be discharged from the hospital. I encouraged her to continue lax laxative use and to drink plenty of fluids to help with her constipation. I also advised her to take several deep breaths several times a day to help relieve her pain. She should also continue to avoid hot tubs and hot showers while she is at the hospital, as this can lead to dehydration.
Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her recovery. I have explained to her that she should continue to work on her strength, range of motion, and endurance as she continues to heal. We discussed that it will take her 2 to 3 months before she feels like she is back to herself again. I also advised her that her return to driving is likely to be determined by when she feels safe to be driving. We also discussed that she will contact me again in 6 weeks to discuss her job availability.

virtscribe-7,VS020,"[doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?
[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .
[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?
[patient] yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .
[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] we automatically thought appendix .
[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .
[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .
[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .
[doctor] wow . okay .
[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .
[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .
[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?
[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .
[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .
[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .
[doctor] mhm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?
[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .
[doctor] got you . okay .
[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .
[doctor] hmm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .
[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?
[patient_guest] only pepcid .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .
[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?
[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .
[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?
[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .
[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?
[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .
[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?
[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .
[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .
[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .
[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .
[patient_guest] you're welcome .
[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?
[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .
[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .
[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , "" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . "" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .
[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?
[patient_guest] correct . yep .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?
[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?
[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .
[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?
[patient] no , not that i've noticed .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .
[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .
[patient_guest] okay . thank you .
[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?
[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .
[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .
[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .
[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .
[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .
[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .
[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .
[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .
[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .
[patient_guest] you too .
[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?
[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?
[doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .
[patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .
[doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-
[patient] he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .
[doctor] not because of it . okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i see what you're saying .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] got it . cool . i'm gon na stop-","
CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right kidney pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ashley James is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney.
The patient reports she was previously healthy, but has been in pain since she was 14 years old. She states she was rubbing her right side and noticed pain. The pain was so bad that she was bent over in pain. Initially, the patient thought she had an appendix. She was treated for a stomach virus and sent home. The next day, she was twice as bad as the first day. The patient was seen by her primary care physician, who was out of town, and treated her for the 2nd day of pain. This was followed up by her specialist, who performed an ultrasound of the right kidney and called the patient in. She notes that the patient was still throwing up when she was seen.


PHYSICAL EXAM


Neurological
- Orientation: Alert and oriented x3. Speech is clear and fluent. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Examination of Heart: Clear. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.


Musculoskeletal
- Assessment: Normal. Her lymph nodes were swollen and they were found to be infected. She vomited a lot. She had burning pain to palpation of the right kidney. The right kidney was smaller than the left. The left kidney was bigger.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray images of the right kidney were obtained and reviewed today and confirm the presence of an atrophic right kidney.
Abdominal x-ray of the abdomen was reviewed and revealed cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries. Her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection.
Echocardiogram revealed a narrowing of the tunnel.
Urgent follow-up appointment was scheduled for the next day, but the primary care physician was out of town on vacation, so the patient was sent to the office in the meantime.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ashley James is a 14-year-old female who was previously healthy. She presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I explained that her symptoms were consistent with an appendix. She was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment. We discussed the possibility of further testing including a kidney biopsy. She declined further treatment. I recommended we refer her to a specialist for further evaluation. She will follow up with me in 2 weeks. I will complete an exam of her heart and lungs and then we will move from there.
