Coronary artery disease\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his ejection fraction was about 30%, which is normal for this stage of the disease. I also advised him to monitor his potassium levels and sodium intake as well as his resting heart rate.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 1 month to check on his kidney function.\n"

His catheterization site is healing well.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of continuing to take his medications to prevent the stent from clogging again and to reduce his chance of another heart attack. I encouraged him to limit his salt intake as an increased amount of sodium can affect the ejection fraction measurement of his heart function.\n- Medical Treatment: The patient is taking a low-dose aspirin, and will continue taking it for life or until he is instructed to discontinue. Continue Brilinta for at least 1 year. Continue Crestor 40 mg once a day. Continue Toprol 50 mg once a day. The patient can resume swimming a few laps. He will enroll in cardiac rehab to gain confidence in returning to exercising and for dietary education and counseling. Liver function studies and lipid panel ordered.

We also discussed the potential side effects of this infection, such as pneumonia, which could include blood clots, heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, cardiac arrest, and death. Additionally, the patient was advised to monitor her blood glucose levels daily and discontinue metformin, which she has been doing well with. I advised her to increase her dose of hydrochlorothiazide from 5 to 7 mg once a day to 10 mg daily, and to continue taking Tylenol as needed for pain and fever. I also recommended that the patient obtain a bilateral bilateral breast cystoscopy to evaluate for possible perforation. If she does not have these, we will consider performing a bilateral echocardiogram to assess for breast cysts."

We discussed this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina leaking fluid and blood.

He understands he is going to be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye, so he is not going to feel any pain. I advised injections given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it. However, I also have to let him know that there could be a situation where he may still note a small amount of vision loss, but this is his best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as he can.
