Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed.

Her blood pressure at last visit was 130 over 90 mm Hg. Her last visit on April 16th was 140 over 90. She was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily, lisinopril 20 mg once daily. Her recent blood pressure readings have improved slightly, but her recent hemoglobin A1c was still elevated.\n\u2022 Alcohol dependence.\nThe patient has been consistent with her alcohol consumption over the past few months, but has recently stopped for a couple of days. She admits to seeing some improvement in her blood pressure in the morning, but does not have any new blood pressure-related symptoms.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient's recent blood glucose levels have improved significantly since her last visit. She is doing well with home blood pressure checks at home, but needs to continue to monitor her levels at home as well as at the clinic. We discussed the importance of alcohol consumption and recommended that she limit her alcohol intake to 0.5 pints of alcohol per day to avoid headaches and dizziness.\n"
