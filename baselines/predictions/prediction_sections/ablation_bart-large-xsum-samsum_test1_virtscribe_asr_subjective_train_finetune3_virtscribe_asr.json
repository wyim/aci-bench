[patient] okay. [doctor] you're going to hear me describe things in detail or repeat things as i go to reference later for my notes. [patient] okay. [doctor] okay then i'm going to be using my status post template ms. sanchez please lie down on the table here and will get started on right can you turn your head to the left head and neck no jvd detected. you can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please. okay, that's good and lungs have reduced breath, but auscultation and percussion are clear. okay, breathe normally. i'm just going to listen to your heart. rhythm is irregularly irregular yet it does sound kind of weird right it is when your heart doesn't beat with the correct rhythm and what ever rhythm it doesn't have a pattern to it so it is part of the atrial fibrillation while that sound like a mass yet it is not ideal but many people have a. fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes ac not good to know okay so s1 slightly accentuated no s3 i'm going to touch your belly and does any of that hurt? [patient] nope. [doctor] how about there and your feet no not really okay great and trace peripheral edema on extremities alright ms. sanchez you can sit up now so it looks like your health heart heart valves are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely l good yes we are we looked at your ecg taken earlier today and we are seeing the a. fib but it is being well controlled with the medicine and you're taking coumadin 4 mg lasix at 4 mg a day and the atenolol you're taking that every day as well right yes the 50 mg every day great it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery great so lets continue on your current meds i'm glad that you are figuring out what your body can handle definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help all your best and that is about it to have any questions for me i do when do i need to come back and get checked out well i don't think you need to come back soon everything from a cardio perspective is fine so i think lets do a follow-up in about 6 to 9 months thank",

[patient] i'm good, thank you. [doctor] good. well, what brings you in to see me today? [patient] well, my doctor says that i have a heart murmur. [doctor] okay. [patient] so i don't know how big a heart murmur i have or really even what it is. [doctor] okay so how long have you had that for? do you have any idea or is that completely new as far as you know? [patient] yeah, she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur, so of course i'm worried as well. [doctor] got it. okay. and are you having any symptoms at all? [patient] i don't think so. i don't know what symptoms i should be having. [doctor] okay. well, so you are 100, so we can't really get around that one, so i expect that you probably don't move quite as fast as maybe you used to. [patient] no, i definitely don't. [doctor] okay. and do you notice that you have any chest pain or feel shortness of breath? [patient] no, i don't have any chest pain. my problem is i have severe pains in my legs and so she had me go in for a chest x-ray and that was just last week. [doctor] okay. [patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs. [doctor] okay, got it for the legs and do you feel short of breath at all? [patient] if i walk too fast or too long or if i try to drink a whole glass of water without stopping, then yeah, i do get short of breath that way. [doctor] okay and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued? [patient] well i do have a walker now, so i don't know, maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or walk around the culvasec. [doctor] got it, alright. [patient] so it isn't that bothersome to me at all maybe more if i try to overdo it. [doctor] okay. [patient] then i i get short of breath if i do overdo it though. [doctor] okay, got it and so how different would you say that these symptoms are now compared to like 6 months ago or a year ago? [patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about 6 months ago. before that, i didn't notice anything at all. [doctor] okay. so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you? [patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now. [doctor] okay and how about do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all? [patient] yeah, so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad. [doctor] okay. [patient] yeah, and i don't take it everyday, only when i do feel dizzy. [doctor] okay, and so how about any passing out at all? [patient] no. [doctor] okay, good. and how about irregular heart beats, do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat? [patient] i don't notice it at all. [doctor] okay, great and how about any swelling in the legs at all? [patient] yeah, my ankles swell. [doctor] okay, and how long has this been going on? [patient] i would say for probably 6 months, but it goes up and down and sometimes it's worse than other times. [doctor] okay and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that? [patient] i lost a little bit of weight, but i still weigh 120 pounds, but i normally weigh about 130 pounds. [doctor] mm-hmm okay. [patient] but that's been going down gradually for about a year. [doctor] okay and then how about any fevers, chills, or anything else that's going on that you can think of? [patient] no. [doctor] good. so mainly it sounds like you came in mostly because of the murmur, is that right and sort of just kinda seeing what things look like? [patient] yeah, that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication. [doctor] okay. and so fatigue as well and have you ever had any testing of your heart done? [patient] i'm not really sure. [doctor] okay. it does look like you've had a decent number of surgeries here uh? [patient] yeah,",

[patient] it's not too bad. [doctor] so it's not bad on the chest or back. you've used some over the counter items like washes and person gel? [patient] yeah. [doctor] do those seem to be helping? [patient] yes, i think so a little bit. [doctor] good. what's your skin care routine like now? [patient] do you wan na know like the things i currently use? [doctor] yes. what do you do for your acne in the morning and then what do you do at nighttime? i wash my face more like i wipe it down in the morning then at night i use an l facial cleanser called the superclarity cleanser. i finish with a toner and then the person gel. when you say wipe your face in the morning, do you use a product or just water? [patient] hmmm just water and a wash cloth really, if i feel really greasy, sometimes i'll use the elf cleanser in the morning too. [doctor] okay and is today a good day, bad day or an average day for you? [patient] hmmm i would say it's probably a good day for me of course since i'm here right? [doctor] acne is always good when you come to see the doctor. do you find that your acne flares with your periods? [patient] no, not really. [doctor] and do you get a regular period? [patient] yep. [doctor] how long have you been getting a regular period? [patient] hmmm i think about 2 years. [doctor] okay. the biggest flare probably was when she started school sports in the fall just with all the sweating. yeah, i'll do it. is there anything else that you've noticed, mrs. ward? [patient] no, kayla really has been doing a good job with the facial care regimen. it just doesn't seem to help as much as we wanted. [doctor] got it. okay. well, let's take a look then. full exam is performed today except for under the underwear and under the bra multiple benign navy on the trunk and extremities scattered skin colored papules open and closed comedones and erythematous papules on the face primarily on the forehead and with also some on the central cheeks and chin. the chest and back are relatively spared. and the remainder of the examination is normal. so what i'm seeing from your exam today is mild to moderate acne, mostly comedonal with small inflammatory component. [patient] okay, so is there anything we can do to help it? [doctor] yes, i would like to start with a topical therapy first. every morning you will wash your face with a mild cleanser. then use a moisturizer label noncommittogenic with sunscreen, spf 30 or higher. this means it won't clog your pors. now in the evening, wash your face with the same cleanser and allow it to dry. apply adapalene 0.1 % cream in a thin layer to the areas you generally get acne. i want you to start off using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night. if it, it is, excuse me, if it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try differin gel over the counter. you can follow that with clean and clear bursa gel and a thin layer where you generally get acne and then a noncommunogenic moisturizer. your topical retinoid won't cause sun sensitivity so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. it may also cause some dryness or irritation. [patient] okay. i can do that. [doctor] you also have multiple benign moles on your arms, legs, back, and abdomen. this means they all look normal with no worrisome features. we will see if you have any progress over the next 6 months and follow up at that time.

[doctor] hi mr. james, i'm dr. isabella, how're you doing? [patient] i'm okay, thank you. [doctor] that's good. that's good. tell me what brings you in today? [patient] sure, so i've been having constant pain in my left shoulder and left elbow for a while about 5 months or so, hurts all the time, pretty bad at times. [doctor] hmmm that does not sound like fun. it sounds like you injured it going up the stairs? [patient] yes, that's correct. it was icy and i have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house. i stepped and my feet just went out, fell on my left side. seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt, it's been hurting since. [doctor] yeah, that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms. anything seemed to make the pain worse? [patient] well, i've always at the gym and lifted weights. i've been trying to keep with my routine of 2 days a week, but it's been hard. the pain is worse when i lift and i haven't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds, which is very frustrating. [doctor] mm-hmm i can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine. [patient] exactly. i really enjoy my exercise, but over the past 1 to 2 weeks i stopped hitting the gym because the pain just wasn't worth it honestly. i do keep up with my walking though. my wife and i walk about 30 minutes almost everyday. we have done this since i retired from my office job last year. [doctor] i do not blame you mr. james. does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried? [patient] not too much. i have iced a bit, but i have not taken anything for the pain. stopping the exercise and some ice has helped a bit, but it still hurts enough for me to come to see you. [doctor] yeah, okay. how about any numbness or tingling, have you felt that at any point? no, document just pain. no tingling or numbness, numbness thankfully. understood, understood. alright, well, let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on.

[doctor] okay. left shoulder and elbow tender sa space. no warmth, erythema, or deformity. positive kiss the elbow and neer's test. normal proximal and distal distal upper extremity strength. intact median, radial, ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees. normal empty can test. okay mr. james what i think you are dealing with is impingement syndrome of your left shoulder. i don't think there is an additional injury or issue with your wrist but because everything is connected. [patient] you're experiencing pain in your wrist because of your shoulder. we do see this type of issue when someone has a fall, so it's good you came to see us, he came in to see us so we could help. so what are the possible treatments? [doctor] well, we have a few options you can try. first option would be to start with physical therapy. i would recommend two sessions per week as well as any other exercises they give, [patient] you to do at home we can start if that doesn't improve your pain then we could try a cortisone injection. [doctor] i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it doesn't help. i am not opposed to a shot, but would like to try the therapy first. alright, great. i'll get a referral ordered and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled. [patient] okay. [doctor] mm-hmm also please continue to ice especially your shoulder and rest as much as you can. [patient] okay, i will. [doctor] give us a call or email if you have symptoms worsen, if your symptoms worsen or do not improve with the therapy. [patient] will do. thank you. i appreciate your help.

[doctor] i'm doing good, thank you, how are you? [patient] i'm great, thanks, so how have you been since the last time, i know the last time we were talking about decreasing your prednisone dose, correct? [doctor] yes, i'm just on one now and that seems to be enough. [patient] that's great to hear. [doctor] yeah, there are a couple of days there, i took an extra one just because there was a little extra pain in my feet and i do have a desk job, so when i have a day off where i'm moving around a lot, they do tend to hurt a bit more. [patient] okay, how many times did you do that? [doctor] it wasn't often maybe once a week. [patient] okay so it sounds like we are still on track for discontinuing the prednisone, we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit and how about the methotrexate, do you think that helped with your joint pain? [doctor] yeah, definitely because i went to get my covid shots but from the letter i got about it, it said that it could interfere with the vaccine, you know, reduce the efficacy, so i didn't take it on the week that i got the first shot. [patient] okay and what happened? [doctor] i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later. [patient] i'm sorry to hear that and, and what did you do about the second dose? [doctor] well i called into the hotline because i was in so much pain with the first one and they said no, just go ahead and take it, so i did. [patient] okay, that's good then. we do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high risk medication. do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time? [doctor] no, they didn't give me one. [patient] okay. so we can do that for you too. so what questions do you have for me, judy? [doctor] well i just wanted to know why i was getting all these bruises here so like when i bump myself, i don't know where they are coming from. [patient] okay, that's probably from the prednisone, it can increase bruising. [doctor] okay, i didn't know that. i don't even feel it when it happens, they just show up. [patient] yeah, unfortunately that can happen but we are working on discontinuing that, so let's see if the bruises do go away. [doctor] okay, that sounds good, thanks. [patient] okay judy, please sit up here and i'll take a look, shoes and socks off please. [doctor] alright. [patient] alright, let me see here, okay, so where is it hurting, in your joints right here? [doctor] yeah, a little also in my feet joints as well. [patient] okay and how about when you bend the knee like this? [doctor] well, it hurt before we increased the methotrexate, but it's doing pretty good now. okay, good. can you flex your toes please? [patient] good range of motion also ridges and nails that's from the psoriasis. [doctor] yeah, they've been like that for a long time now. [patient] okay. alright miss gomez it looks like we are moving along with your treatment nicely. we will stop your prednisone and continue with the methotrexate. make sure you stop by the front desk and make an appointment for the blood work and i'll see you in 3 months.

        "source": " [doctor] kelly wood, date of birth february 15, 1979. established patient here for renal ultrasound because of hematuria. urine dipstick today negative for leukocytes, nitrates, protein, ketones, bilirubin and glucose color yellow and clear. urobilinogen 0.2, ph 5.5, and specific gravity 1.020. there is a trace amount of blood in the urine and intact. renal ultrasound, impression, right kidney is 10 cm in length by 5 cm wide. there are no stones, masses, or hydronephrosis. the left kidney is 10.8 cm in length and 5 cm wide. there is a 6 mm left renal stone nonobstructing. 533 ml prevoid and 0 ml post void. hi mrs. wood, i see you just finished your ultrasound. [patient] yes ma'am. [doctor] well, it looks like you have 1 stone in the left kidney, but it's not obstructing anything. [patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone. i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment and then for the past 6 weeks, i've had a few episodes of bright red urine, the color of like cherry cholestee, and last week i was constantly having to pee, and it hurt something terrible. [doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of 0-10, zero being no pain and 10 being worst as you can imagine. [patient] at the time i'd say an eight. [doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back? [patient] no, after passing those stones, things have felt a lot better. [doctor] that's good to hear. now, it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 mg a day and have no drug allergies. is that correct? [patient] that's right. [doctor] alright, well let's take a look at you today. let's use my default pe. well mrs. wood, we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones. fortunately you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided. you do still have 1 stone in the left kidney. since it's not obstructing or causing pain, i don't recommend any surgical intervention at this time. [patient] i would like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones. [doctor] as we discussed last time, the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause. but several factors increase the risk such as dehydration, family history, certain foods, digestive tract disease, and certain medical conditions. [patient] yeah i know i don't drink near the amount of water that i should. i drink more mountain dew than anything. [doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day. [patient] so if i weigh 250 pounds, i should drink. [doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew. [patient] okay. is there any food i shouldn't eat? [doctor] great question. you should avoid food rich in sodium, oxalate, and animal protein. so that would be salty, processed foods because they are high in sodium. ideally you should consume less than 1000 mg of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef, poultry, fish, and pork. [patient] what's oxalate? [doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants that when digested, it binds to minerals that stones are formed from foods like spinach, chocolate, beets, rubar, and soy products. [patient] well, i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again. [doctor] great and here is a handout that you can look over. it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid. [patient] okay, good. i like to have things in writing to help you remember. [doctor] perfect. well, if you have any more questions, if you don't have any more questions, you're all set, i won't need to see you back until next year as long as you don't have any more issues like bleeding or pain. if you do have any issues, you can always call the office sooner and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine, you should go to the emergency room. [patient] alright, well, let's hope we don't have to do either of those and i see you next year. [doctor] yes, so let's hope. come right this way and i'll walk you to check out. update pe abdomen, no flank pain and to gu. normal vaginal exam. primary diagnosis is hematuria. secondary diagnosis is chronic urolithiasis. thank you. this is complete. mrs.",
