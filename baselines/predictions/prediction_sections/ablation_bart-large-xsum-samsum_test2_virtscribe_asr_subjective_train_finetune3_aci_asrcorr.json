[patient] yeah i thought i was getting better and have a new primary doctor and she put me on a new medication about a month ago. [doctor] can you tell me which medications you are taking? [patient] my new med is a combo med something 4025. [doctor] okay yes this is at your chart the benicar hct it has hydrochlorothiazide in it yet that sent my water pill i call it okay are you still taking the amlodipine 10 mg daily yes i am. [patient] that's that's a good start regimen are you checking your blood pressure at home and if yes what numbers are you seeing? [doctor] every day. [patient] awesome. [doctor] yeah every morning i take it when i get up and been running about 1:46 to 1:55 lately. not down in the 120s yet no not yet while we are trying to get there though okay how are you doing with your salt intake charted back off of it i think i'm doing good with it not eating too much good i play huge part in lowering your pressure and staying away from salt is important information on the\u2013eating plan which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure sounds good are you doing any exercise i do try and walk on the treadmill when i can okay great so let's take a look throughout your exam just like you make sure i get everything documented okay. please use my general physical exam template let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good. [patient] alright. [doctor] your heart and lungs sound good so that's great. [patient] good to hear. [doctor] alright go ahead and lie down and let me know if anywhere i press hurts. no, nowhere. alright, so i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet. i'm just gon na look for some swelling. [patient] alright. [doctor] so in terms of getting that pressure down you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down and the question is what do we need to do to get your. [patient] to get it down. your potassium 1 week ago was 4.0 has it been redone since in the last week? [doctor] no. okay for is good for your potassium level some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in the body often it is a form response if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age 8 out of 10 would respond to reduce salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure but for the 2 out of 10 there is something else driving parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands over produce aldosterone which we call hyperaldosterone okay so is there is something we can do about it in these cases there is medicine called spironolactone that is very effective at dropping the aldosterone level and your blood pressure and i think we should give that a try i mean i'm willing to give it a try okay so lets discuss the piss of the possible risks of being on hydrochlorothiazide thiazide which is the fluid meds that you're now on and the spironolactone one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance they can also cause dehydration so when as you got to make sure that you hydrate you do not hydrate and you get dehydrated you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up second thing is this spironolactone can raise your potassium too far is rare but it can you're starting with your potassium at four so that gives us some room to feel a bit better and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrochlorothiazide chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down now this does not meet mean that you need to be eating more salt okay but it does mean that you will need to do blood test in 2 weeks to make sure that it's okay. alright that i can do are there any other side effects i need to worry about? [patient] dizziness possibly as well as one in 100 guys might develop. [doctor] tenderness",

[doctor] good as well. so it sounds like we are under good control right now. [patient] yes, it's doing much better. [doctor] good, good. do you have any rash left over? [patient] yeah, i have a, a small bit left over. i started using doxycycline only once a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better to just limit it to once a day. [doctor] okay, that sounds good. [patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lot of improvement. [doctor] okay. [patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day, it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better, so it's kinda plateaued a little bit. [doctor] i see are you breast-feeding at this time? [patient] no, not right now. [doctor] okay, good. so you, you should not be breast-feeding while you're on that medication. [patient] yeah, actually i stopped breast-feeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time. [doctor] okay. even with the doxycycline, you can keep using the elidel. [patient] okay and i didn't take the elidel because when i read about it, i got worried, so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see. okay, so we can talk about the elidel. a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form, but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses long term after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that. okay, i didn't realize that. [doctor] yeah, and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long, it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers. it doesn't apply to as needed use of the medicine, a cream or an ointment, okay? [patient] okay, then i can resume taking, taking the doxycycline twice a day again. [doctor] so let me clarify. what exactly are you using and then we will look at you and figure out, okay? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash how frequently are you using that one? [patient] twice a day. [doctor] okay, and that's not drying you out too much? [patient] no, that's fine. [doctor] okay, and you're using the metrocream? [patient] yes. [doctor] how often are you using that one? [patient] after my face wash, i immediately apply the cream. [doctor] okay and then are you using any other kind of lotions or anything? [patient] no. [doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser? [patient] i'm not. [doctor] okay, and no neutrogena wipes? [patient] no wipes. [doctor] okay. and then what about any lotions that you're using? [patient] i'm not using any lotion right now, just those two. [doctor] no lotion, okay. so that may be something else we should add in a lotion to just help moisturize, but we will see. [patient] okay. [doctor] and then again when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day? [patient] that was last week, so the first 2 weeks i did twice a day. [doctor] okay. [patient] and then i started seeing improvement and then i changed to just once a day. [doctor] okay. let me take a look at your face here. i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing you're fitzpatrick skin type iv meaning you're not going to burn, you're going to suntan essentially 4-5. [patient] and then on bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils. so you're right, it's not totally gone. yeah. [doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day everyday with the doxycycline. [patient] okay. [doctor] but i would pick up the elidel too. [patient] okay, i can do that. [doctor] i mean i have known risks associated with medications, topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications. with that being said, doxycycline is low risk. [patient] it is, okay.

[patient] i'm good, thank you. so gosh, we last talked a little bit over a year ago, and it was just a telemedicine visit, but it seems like you've been doing pretty good. i know there was an insurance change. i think you had switched over to wixela, is that right? [doctor] yep, that's right, and it's what i'm currently using. [patient] okay and that's the 250 50 dose, correct? [doctor] yes, correct. [patient] perfect. so how does that compare? [doctor] i mean it's working well. i really haven't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night. [patient] and that's 1 puff twice a day. [doctor] mm-hmm. [patient] okay and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all? [doctor] rarely and if i do, it's really just before a workout or something like that if i know i'm really gon na be pushing it. [patient] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity. [doctor] yes. [patient] okay. so you can do things like going to walk or going to the grocery store, no problem and just use it for more exertional stuff. [doctor] yes like if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative. [patient] okay. [doctor] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon. [patient] no kidding, that's great. [doctor] yeah, so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler. [patient] really? [doctor] yeah and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler, it makes it easier. [patient] and so my inhaler, do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers? [doctor] mm-hmm so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test and then they'll see how the asthma affects me and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever. so i have been taking it less and less and really some days i feel like i don't need it. [patient] and that is the wixela that you're not taking. so on average per week, how many days of the week, do you use 1 puff in the morning and 1 puff at night? [doctor] probably about three or four. [patient] okay, 3 to 4 days/week and the other days, it's once a day? [doctor] yes, that's correct. [patient] okay. [doctor] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it. [patient] okay, do you think that's working okay? [doctor] i do. [patient] great and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year? [doctor] nope. [patient] okay, so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then? [doctor] nope. [patient] okay and now military wise, what's the timeframe of when you be completing some of these exertional tests, like what are your next steps? [doctor] so hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring 2022 so that gives me about 6 to 7 months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i don't really need the inhaler or at least show them that i have it under control. [patient] now when you were in the other room, you completed a breathing test, correct? correct. okay, great. so now let me ask you about the allergies, because i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall, correct? [doctor] yeah",

Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.\n\nMrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.\n\nShe hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.\n\nOver the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.\n\nShe notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.\n\nMrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.\n\nShe has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.\n\nThe patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nAsthma.\nAllergy rhinitis.\nFood allergies to peanut and tree nuts.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nCurrently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nWixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.\nProair HFA as needed.\nEpiPen as needed.\nAlvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nPeanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.\nMontelukast sodium, \u201cseizure-like\u201d reaction.\n\n",

[patient] hi document this is my daughter theresa, she is the one who helps me keep things straight. [doctor] mr. watson, have you been sick or been hospitalized since your shunt shunt surgery 3 months ago? [patient] not that i recall. no, he hasn't. he has been doing much better. [doctor] good. i'm glad to hear that. before surgery, you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking, thinking, and bladder control. are these symptoms better, worse, or unchanged? his walking has improved. he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but he could not do that before surgery. he still has times where i have to help him. [patient] that's impressive mr. watson? [doctor] yeah, i guess. now his bladder control did improve some after surgery but now seems to have leveled out, so he is wearing diapers. [patient] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper and any decreased or painful urination? [doctor] no, not at all. and how about cognition? [patient] i think i'm better. i don't feel lost when talking to someone anymore. [doctor] dan and i both think my sister, hannah summarized it best. she said i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again. not so wonderful. now, have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is? [patient] no, hasn't bothered me 1 bit. [doctor] okay and any pain in your belly at all? [patient] can't say that i have. [doctor] okay. sounds like you have been improving. alrighty, mr. watson, i'm gon na step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me. is that alright? [patient] sounds good. [doctor] okay. i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month and then we will chat about it when i come in. alrighty mr. watson, so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery. now on ct scan though, i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region. [patient] now i don't believe that that's causing any symptoms and i, it actually wasn't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan. [doctor] what does that mean? just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another 2 to 3 months before we go in changing it. like i said, if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved, so that's all good for me. so really there is, there is nothing to worry about. alright, so i'll come back in 3 months. [patient] yep, that's right. [doctor] i do have a question for you though. [patient] yeah, of course. [doctor] do you think i will be able to drive again? man, mr. watson, i knew you were gon na ask me that one. i think at this point, it's unlikely that your movement, speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver's safety evaluation. now, i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me. by improving over a 9 to 12-month range and that, that definitely could be you, you could definitely pass it at that point. so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that, then you know i think it could be possible, and i would be happy to recommend it. now, you could definitely also enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, so you could kind of do that preemptively and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go.

[patient] about the same as last time. my knee is still swollen. [doctor] that was your right knee, correct? i take it the injection, did it help? [patient] it did maybe for a couple of weeks. [doctor] that's it and is it still painful? [patient] yeah, it's pretty painful and now the whole leg is getting swollen. [doctor] okay. what would you say your pain level is? [patient] i mean right now it's about a three or so but typically on the normal day, it's around six. [doctor] okay and it's been swollen like that for how long now? [patient] since i was last here a couple of weeks after that, so about maybe 2 months now. [doctor] okay, but before it was just the knee? [patient] yeah, the whole thing wasn't swollen like this, but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time but it hasn't been helping. [doctor] okay. okay. so that hasn't been working for you. [patient] i mean it helps to some degree but it's still swollen especially around the knee. [doctor] hmmm has it been keeping you from doing things during the day? [patient] well i slowed down a little bit and i try to do things too fast but when it really hurts is when i've been sitting for a while and then i try to get up. i'm so stiff getting up, i have to use a cane to get my bearings i mean after a little bit it loosens up but at first getting up is really difficult. [doctor] yeah, i can see, that makes sense. have you been taking your medication regularly? you're on xeljanz, right? [patient] yeah, the xr i think it's 11 mg a day, yeah, but i'm taking it everyday and i'm also taking celebrex, which i started maybe 2 months ago. [doctor] yeah, the 200 mix daily. how is that working for you? [patient] pretty good up until this started swelling again. [doctor] okay well come sit over here and if you could take off your socks and shoes and we will take a look at your knee. and just to let you know, i have a service now that writes my note about the visit so you'll hear, hear me call things out and describe what i see fully. okay, gotcha. [patient] right, so let's check your leg, can you straighten it and does it hurt? yeah, when i try to straighten it all the way, it does. [doctor] okay. range of motion slightly diminished. i'm going to press here, okay? and how about here? hmmm i see some pitting around the knee and ankle. normal capillary refill in the toes. does any of this area hurt? [patient] just like an old bruise. [doctor] so i can feel that the knee is hot and that means there is something going on like some inflammation so we can give you another steroid injection for that. i also want to get an x-ray of that knee so we can see where all the swelling is coming from. yeah sounds good to me. [patient] okay and do we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here? [doctor] no i was doing some years ago, but that was the other knee. okay so i think we will set that up for you now. we will also do an x-ray on that knee i can send you for a physical therapy and if nothing is helping then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee. [patient] okay. sounds like a plan. [doctor] alright, so for today, we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot. i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection. there might be no fluid, but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless. [patient] okay and that's the procedure you're gon na do right now? [doctor] yep once we're done talking here and as far as the edema in your legs, we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause, but there is a lot you can. do as well. the compression socks are a good start and also do you eat a lot of salt?
