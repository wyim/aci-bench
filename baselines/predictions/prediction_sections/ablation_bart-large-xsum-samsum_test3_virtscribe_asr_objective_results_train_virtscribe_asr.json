[patient] hello, are you mrs. king? [doctor] i am. [patient] i'm dr. phillips, very nice to meet you. [doctor] you as well. [patient] how can i help you today? [doctor] well, my primary doctor, dr. scott, he referred me here. [patient] okay. [doctor] i've just got really bad acid reflux. [patient] okay. can you tell me more about it? [doctor] yeah. so i mean i, right now i take 40 mg of omeprazole twice a day. some days it is fine, but others are just really bad. what do you feel? [patient] it feels like burning. [doctor] in your chest? [patient] yes, in my chest and also in my throat. [doctor] in your throat and chest, alright. any difficulty with swallowing? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck? [patient] no. [doctor] okay. that's good. any abdominal pain? [patient] no, not really. [doctor] nausea or vomiting, changes in bowel movements? [patient] no. [doctor] constipation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding? [patient] nope. [doctor] okay. very good. and how long have you had this problem? [patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12, but it has gotten worse over the past few years. [doctor] okay and how long have you been on the omeprazole? [patient] on the way it is now i think about a year. [doctor] okay. do you find that it's done anything for you in the past? i mean i can tell it's helped because some days i'll be fine and then some days i eat something and it feels terrible. are there anything that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint like food choices or stress? sure, probably stress and food choices sometimes. okay. what things bother you? [patient] spicy foods so i try not to eat them too often but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it. we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that even sodas even just the carbonation can cause that. how about tomato based products or citrus products? [doctor] yeah sometimes but i still eat them. okay. it's reassuring that you aren't having any difficulty swallowing though. how has your weight been? pretty stable? [patient] i would say pretty stable although i haven't had much of an appetite for the past 2 months. i have been under a lot of work stress. [doctor] what do you do for work? [patient] i'm a paralegal. [doctor] okay and any family history of gi issues? [patient] my grandmother had esophageal cancer. [doctor] on your mom or dad's side? [patient] mom's side and my mom had some issues like acid reflux and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach. [doctor] okay. have you ever had an upper endoscopy? [patient] i think maybe when i was younger. [doctor] but not in the last 10 years? [patient] no. [doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole? [patient] at one point i was on omeprazole and ranitidine, it did help. [doctor] but other than that, those are the only medications i have taken. [patient] okay. have a seat here and let me listen to your heart and lungs and then we can talk about a plan for you. [doctor] okay. so normal physical exam per my new patient template except for a well-healed abdominal surgical scar is noted. what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from? i always forget about that surgery. i had it when i was a baby. my mom said my intestines were twisted, so i had to have surgery when i was around 1 month old. gotcha, okay. so let's talk about what you have going on. from what you've told me, it sounds like you've had a several year history of gerd, which is the medical term for acid reflux. [patient] and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication, correct? [doctor] yes. and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato based foods, but you haven't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet. [patient] so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd even though you're taking the",

[doctor] hi michelle, how are you doing? [patient] not too bad and yourself? [doctor] i'm good, thanks. so it looks like you had an infection, right? [patient] yeah but you know i really don't think it was a uti. [doctor] okay. [patient] i told them when i went to the er is that your phone. [doctor] it is, yeah. it listens to your knee and it does all of my documentation. it's pretty good stuff. tell me what's going on. [patient] it is in my humble opinion that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high and i hardly pooped when i was there. then when i got home, i had a massive poop and i felt much better. i told them that when i was admitted and they did x-rays and everything, but they said no, as they didn't think that wasn't, that was it. but you know i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped. okay white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high. so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count. [doctor] typically it doesn't. [patient] okay. [doctor] but i mean when i look at the urine cultures that they checked, the cultures are not very impressive. [patient] yeah, that's what they said. and when i go back and look, sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit and last year it was normal so. [doctor] hmmm. but it's saying that you know inflammation can do that, so yeah, you could be backed up and inflamed. [patient] yeah. [doctor] they didn't do a cat scan, they just did an x-ray but you feel like you are back to your normal self now? [patient] yeah. i mean i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control. [doctor] mm-hmm. [patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up and i know at that point i'm out of the loss of what i can do at home. yeah that you went in. so i went in and they made me feel better and then i went home as you know. [doctor] well, maybe that's all it was. [patient] yeah. [doctor] so you're doing good otherwise? [patient] yes, i am. [doctor] good. lem me take a quick listen to you. [patient] okay. [doctor] alright, go ahead and take a few deep breaths and breathe normally. [patient] now take several deep breaths. [doctor] two more. okay, good. you can relax. any pain or discomfort anywhere? [patient] no. [doctor] great. so here are my thoughts. [patient] okay. you may recall it was extremely hot during that period of going to the hospital. i don't know if you were inside for the most part. yeah, it was pretty hot, wasn't it and i go out a bit, but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot. okay well if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit, it can lead to further or worsening constipation issues. [doctor] mm-hmm. [patient] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff and i blame it a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last 2 weeks of june so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then if you could come back in and we could do some complete blood work including your white blood cells and a full panel, cholesterol since it's been a while.

[patient] hi, good afternoon ashley, how are you doing? [doctor] i'm doing okay. how are you? [patient] i'm doing well, thanks so much for asking. i'm dr. rogers, i'm one of your kidney doctors and you guys must be mom and dad. [doctor] yes, that's correct. great. well, alright, it's so nice to meet all of you. i wish it was under better circumstances, but we are gon na figure it all out here today. speaking of that, let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history, [patient] and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kinda move from there. would that be alright with you, ashley? [doctor] yeah, that sounds good. [patient] okay. so as i understand it, ashley was found to have a small, a kind of a small kidney on one side. [doctor] tell me about when that was. i do also have records of everything, but i just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here today. [patient] sure so ashley came home 1 day sick out of nowhere, rubbing her stomach and she said it was hurting her on her right side and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain. [doctor] okay. [patient] they automatically thought appendix. [doctor] sure that makes a lot of sense. we took her to her doctor, they treated her for a stomach virus, they gave her fluids and sent her back home and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day. [patient] goodness, okay. than what happened. [doctor] yeah, so i took her back again and they did more testing. i think they did an ultrasound or something and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger. [patient] okay. [doctor] then at that time, they told us to follow up with our primary the next day, which we did but he was heading out on vacation so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door. so she was still throwing up in a lot of pain so i took work off to help her. [patient] wow okay. [doctor] we took her down to jacksonville where they did see her and basically told us the same thing that they didn't think one of her kidneys was working at all. they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one. [patient] already then, then what happened. [doctor] yeah, then they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places. her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection. they told us to follow up with her doctor, which we figured since she was still sick. [patient] okay. and then when you followed up with your doctor, what happened then? [doctor] yeah, it didn't seem to be getting any better within a day or two, so we followed back up with her doctor, who was course still out of town with no one to see her in his place, so we ended up coming to atlanta. we stayed here for about 4 days. they did see her and treated her. [patient] okay. i am so sorry for all of that back and forth, but glad to know that there was some late at the end of that tunnel. [doctor] thank you. and then after they saw her, she did seem to get a little better. she hasn't had any more throwing up or anything since. but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach. [patient] hmmm. okay. [doctor] yeah and she mentions burning too, especially when she eats and stuff like that. alrighty, okay, well that was a really good review. so ashley before all of this, would you say that all in all you were a pretty healthy child? she is, yeah, before that, she was completely fine. they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might have affected her kidney. [patient] gotcha. okay. so one other thing too when she was 4 years old, she was in the hospital three or four times sometimes for 3 days at a time. i don't think they did any test to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from. they just gave her fluids, an antibiotic and they would send us home.

[patient] hi dr. martinez, this weekend was a bit rough. i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now. [doctor] so it's in both of your hands? [patient] yes, ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them, well once they healed i mean i noticed it more, the tingling and the numbness, [doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist? [patient] no, i also wear the left sometimes, the right is just worse but the splint helps. both have really gotten worse over the last month and i broke them my right wrist was definitely in worse shape. i've also been having some mild stiffness in my neck too. i hit my head during the accident and they told me it was a contusion. [doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is? [patient] on this side, it goes from here and here up to about here on the other side, it's from here to here. [doctor] i see. so on the right side you're pointing from the middle and ring finger all the way up the forearm and on the left the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness? it's mainly just sore, sometimes they throb but overall they feel weaker too especially when i'm using them. the tingling happens more when they hurt, but when it goes away, the tingling is dull. [patient] and when do you feel these symptoms? well, really i guess just more so at night and they come and go throughout the day. [doctor] okay and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers? [patient] like feeling something, no, not that i can really think of though in general they maybe less sensitive than they should be but i can still feel they also gave me some nerve pain medicine, but i haven't been taking it like i should. [doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety? [patient] yes, i'm still taking those. i had prediabetes too, but i got it under control by changing my diet. [doctor] and no history of thyroid issues, correct? [patient] no. [doctor] ri thank you mr. cook okay first we'll go over your review of systems correct me if i'm wrong in any of this constitutional you have fatigue and weight gain gi you have excessive appetite and bloating eyes have floaters, cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling, endocrine, you're always hungry, skin, you have some nailbed changes, dryness, and itching, musculoskeletal, you have gout and muscle pain, and the remainder of the review of systems is negative. [patient] yeah, that's all correct. [doctor] alright we are going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination. let's look at the right hand first. can you feel this? [patient] yeah, but a little less on these two fingers. [doctor] sensation is normal except pinprick sensation diminished in the third and fourth fingers on the right and how about on the left? [patient] yeah but these two are little less. [doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. okay, let's test your reflexes now. reflexes are 1+ and symmetric. 2+ knees, toes are downgoing bilaterally. alright, i'm going to tap on your right wrist. do you feel anything? [patient] yeah, it feels like a zing of my wrist and something into my elbow too. [doctor] and how about the left side? [patient] yeah, same on that side too. [doctor] tinel's sign positive at both wrists and both elbows. rest of exam is normal. alright so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or potentially this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome. however, your symptom presentation suggests bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as the nerves in your wrist are aggravated by your past trauma. this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me. okay. so how we make it better? first, i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. we will need to schedule you for a nerve test, which is called an emg test. they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you're having your issues.

[patient] okay, i'm so happy with how the surgery went. i have no pain. [doctor] yeah, you know you're still early in your recovery, so i expect you to get even better than what you are now so keep doing your pt to work on your strength, range of motion, and endurance.

[doctor] you're probably still gon na have aches and pains occasionally. i usually tell people it's two or 3 months before you feel like you're back to yourself again, so you're doing really well.

[doctor] yeah, let's plan to talk again in 6 weeks so if you stop at the desk on your way out today, they'll going to get you set up for a telemedicine visit and that visit will just be to check in and see how you're doing and make sure things are progressing okay.
