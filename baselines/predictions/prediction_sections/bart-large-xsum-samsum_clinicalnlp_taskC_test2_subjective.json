Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.\n\nMrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.\n\nShe hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.\n\nOver the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.\n\nShe notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.\n\nMrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.\n\nShe has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.\n\nThe patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nAsthma.\nAllergy rhinitis.\nFood allergies to peanut and tree nuts.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nCurrently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nWixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.\nProair HFA as needed.\nEpiPen as needed.\nAlvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nPeanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.\nMontelukast sodium, \u201cseizure-like\u201d reaction.\n\n",

He denies he fell down and denies he hit his head on the ground. He initially thought his ankle was the cause of the pain, but after the ankle soreness went away, he noticed that his knee sort of clicks when he walked. The patient states that it does not click when he stands or walks with one foot extended, but only when he leans his foot up against the wall. He states that the clicking is the most noticeable when he is resting or lying down. He has been taking ibuprofen for the pain at night, which he believes helps him to settle down and sleep better. He reports some numbing and tingling in his right foot, but denies any new pain. He broke his right toe 3 times in the last 10 years, so it was not caused by the knee injury.

The onset of her pain began 1 week ago, when she fell and twisted her left knee while helping her daughter learn how to take off the training wheels for her bike. She states she heard a pop when she twisted her knee. She has been limping ever since and it has not gotten better. The patient rates her pain level as 4 out of 10, but she thinks it is getting worse and it is starting to throbbing. She describes her pain as being more on the medial aspect of her knee and less on the lateral aspect. She denies any knee pain associated with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. The only treatment she has so far has been Tylenol and wrapping her knee with kinesiology tape. She reports that she has been taking some tylenol, but notes that she had a ulcer not too long ago so she is not supposed to take any more than every 4 hours. She can't take ibuprofen as it"
