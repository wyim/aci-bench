She is constipated and this appears to be the likely cause of her elevated blood pressure, as she hardly pooped while she was in the hospital. She also had a headache and nausea at the time of admission, but this did not appear to be related to her medical condition.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue with IV antibiotic therapy. Continue home-based laxative use. If she continues to have constipation, we may need to consider a colonoscopy to evaluate for possible ulcerative colitis.\n"
