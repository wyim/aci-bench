CHIEF COMPLAINT

Upper respiratory infection.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrew Smith is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and covid vaccines, who presents today with an upper respiratory infection and shortness of breath. The patient was doing a bit of work out in the yard in the last week or so and started to feel really tired. He was lifting heavy bags of soil and got really winded. He felt a little warm, but thought it was because he was exerting himself. He denies any other symptoms like muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue, or dyspnea. He has been monitoring his blood pressure at home and has been doing well. He is taking medication for his depression. He reports that he has been watching his diet and sugar intake. He states that if he is going to work during the week, he is regular about monitoring it, but if it is a saturday or sunday, he usually forgets to do so. He notes that he is doing well with his depression, but has been a little concerned about that for the past year and a half. He feels that it has
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.• Musculoskeletal: Tenderness to palpation of the knees and elbows. Some tension around the knees.

VITALS REVIEWED
• General Examination: No jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits. No lymphadenopathy.


RESULTS

Diabetes panel: Glucose and hemoglobin A1c are elevated.

Rapid strep test is normal.
Abdominal x-ray is unremarkable. No fractures or osteoarthritis noted.


X-ray of the chest demonstrates good bony alignment. No fracture or arthritis noted. No evidence of any fractures or arthritis. Mild-to-moderate lumbar regurgitation is noted. Mild to moderate chondromalacia is suspected.
PFT: Within normal limits.
Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction.
Lipid panel: Elevated cholesterol.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Andrew is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type two diabetes, and hypertension who presents today with an upper respiratory infection.

Urine culture.
• Medical Reasoning: His symptoms are consistent with a respiratory infection, but his symptoms do not appear to be related to allergies or colds. He has been compliant with his current medications and has been taking his anti-inflammatory medications as prescribed. We discussed the possibility of starting him on meloxicam, but I want to see how he tolerates the medication before we start him on that. I also want to observe his blood pressure at home to see if his levels have been elevated at all since this episode of his infection. If they have, we may need to consider adding another medication to his current regimen. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his blood pressures and blood sugar levels.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Annual exam.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux who presents today for her annual exam. It has been a year since she last saw the doctor. The patient has been walking like you told her to, exercising and doing yoga, and that has helped with her arthritis a lot. She has not had any joint pain recently. She reports that when she starts to get stressed, her palpitations start to flare up again. She notes that she has been trying meditation and running with her dog to relieve the stress but it has not been working. She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or dyspnea. She is currently taking methotrexate once a week for her a-fib and has been doing well with her reflux. She had a review of systems with the physician last month and endorsed some nasal congestion due to allergies. She was placed on Protonix, which has been helpful. She states that she is no longer experiencing nasal congestion. She also denies any stiffness or pain
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

• Musculoskeletal: No pain to palpation of the right elbow. No joint pain. No erythema.

VITALS REVIEWED
• Abdomen: In no apparent distress. No carotid bruits.


RESULTS

Electrocardiogram demonstrates a slight 2/6 systolic- ejection murmur.

A-fib is present. No evidence of coronary artery disease.
Abdominal x-ray demonstrates good bony alignment. No fractures noted. No osteoarthritis noted.
Rapid strep test demonstrates good progression of the rheumatoid arthritis.
Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction. Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Lipid panel demonstrates mild to moderate effusion.
Non-melanocyte count is within normal limits.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux who presents today for her annual exam.

Arthritis.
• Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with methotrexate once a week for the past year and is doing well with her arthritis. She has not had any joint pain or flare ups over the last year, however, she does have a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, which we've heard in the past, which may be related to her recent exacerbation of her a-fib. She also has a right elbow contusion, which could be the source of her elbow pain. We will order an echocardiogram to evaluate for a possible fracture of the ulnar collateral ligament. She will follow up with me in a few weeks to check on her progress and if any new symptoms develop.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to treat her as previously instructed.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Emergency room follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Albert Martinez is a 62-year-old male, with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant, who is here today for emergency room follow up. He was seen by Dr. Reyes about 3 weeks ago for an elevated blood sugar level. He states that he was not really monitoring his blood sugar levels and felt a little woozy over the weekend. He denies any fever, chills, or changes in appetite. He notes that he has been very busy and has been eating fast food on the weekends. He has been following his diet pretty closely. He is taking immunotherapy meds. The patient reports that his depression has been pretty good for the past 1.5 years, but he has had his moments. He feels better now. He continues to medicate for depression. He reports that he is doing well with his meds, but has not been as consistent as he would like with his diet. He also notes that his mother was in the hospital the last week. She had a hip replacement. She is feeling better now but we have been just grabbing meals
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.• Musculoskeletal: 1+ pitting edema in the bilateral lower extremities.

VITALS REVIEWED

Examination of the right lower extremity shows no additional edema. The patient is in no apparent distress. No additional treatment is needed.


RESULTS

Previous hemoglobin A1c is elevated.

Kidney function is good.
Abdominal x-ray is unremarkable.
Non-fasting glucose is within normal limits.
Lipid panel is normal.
Rapid strep test is negative.
X-ray of the abdomen shows no evidence of coronary artery disease. No fractures or osteoarthritis.
Mitral regurgitation is present.
Autoimmune panel is stable.
PFT is within acceptable limits. No evidence of renal disease.
Creatinine levels are normal. These are normal for his age.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN


1. Type 2 diabetes.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended that we continue to monitor his blood sugar levels. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review his results. I will also refer him to his primary care physician for further evaluation. I advised him to continue taking his immunotherapy meds, as well as his meloxicam. I also recommended that he discontinue smoking and alcohol. He should also continue to observe his diet.
• Medical Reasoning: He is a 62-year-old male, with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant, who is here today for emergency room follow-up. His last visit to the hospital was about 3 weeks ago for a hip replacement. He has been compliant with his diet and is doing well with his medications, but his blood glucose levels were elevated over the weekend. I want to get an echocardiogram to see if there is any reason for his elevated readings.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Annual exam.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Jerry Smith is a 54-year-old male with a past medical history significant for osteoporosis and multiple sclerosis who presents for an annual exam. He presents for his annual physical exam. The patient reports that he has been traveling all over the country and has been experiencing lack of sleep. He denies any other issues, chest pain, shortness of breath, or dyspnea. He has been taking Fosamax 1 tab per week. He reports that his insomnia has been getting to him and he has tried everything from melatonin to meditation to stretching out every morning when he gets up, but nothing really seems to help. He is currently taking FOSAMAX. He last saw the neurologist 6 months ago and is taking the medication. He notes that he was having some issues with his right leg, but that seems to have improved. He states that his knee surgery has been a lingering issue with his knee, but other than that it has been fine. His right knee x-ray of his right knee shows some changes from arthritis, but otherwise that looks good, and he is encouraged by that.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds. Bilateral right knee x-ray shows some changes from arthritis, but otherwise that looks good. No broken bones recently.

Musculoskeletal: Some weakness of the lower extremities. Right knee shows some erythema of the right knee. No additional weakness. No pain to palpation.


RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal some changes from arthritis. There is no evidence of any fracture or osteoarthritis.

The neurologist reviewed the X-rays today and is encouraged by the results. The right knee is about 4 out of 5. The left knee is slightly different. The x-rays show some changes in the cartilage. No fractures were noted.


Impression: Significant for osteoporosis and multiple sclerosis.
Abdominal x-ray is unremarkable. No evidence of fractures.
Echocardiogram demonstrates mild arthritis.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. Jerry is a 54-year-old male with a past medical history, significant for osteoporosis and multiple sclerosis who presents for an annual exam.

Multiple sclerosis.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with his current medication, fosamax, for the past 6 months. His symptoms have improved since his last visit, but he still has some weakness in his lower extremities, as well as a lingering issue with his right knee. He presents today with a right knee x-ray, which shows some changes from arthritis, but otherwise that looks good. We will proceed with a refill of his medication, 1 tab per week, to continue his current regimen. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options, including additional medication refills.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Martinez is a 43-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of right arm pain following hitting her arm on the net. She states she was playing tennis when she missed the ball and hit the top of the net but the pole part and it just jarred her arm. She denies any numbness in her hand or wrist. She has a history of allergies and takes flonase. She also had a trauma to her arm when she fell doing lawn work. She was wondering where she was going to go with that. She is currently taking Motrin 800 mg 3 times a day with food.

The patient states that it takes him a little while to adjust to walking when he gets up. He does not have problems lying flat in bed. He is not ready to try any medications just yet. He notes that he is doing well during the holiday season, but he has not seen anything spike in his blood sugars recently. He reports that his alcohol intake has been reduced. He also has been cutting back on his red bull and caffeine.

- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Musculoskeletal
- Examination of Abdomen: Slight swelling in the lower extremities. No pain to palpation of the right lower extremity. No carotid bruits. No calf tenderness. No plantarflexion. No hematoma.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Lawrence is a 62-year-old male, with a past medical history significant for type i diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.

Chest x-ray.
• Medical Reasoning: He has been experiencing a decrease in his oxygen levels over the past few days, which may be related to his recent increase in alcohol intake. He has also had some swelling in his legs, which is likely related to the increase in his alcohol intake over the last couple of weeks. He is currently on Omeprazole for his reflux and is doing well with this medication. We will discuss further treatment options with him in the coming days. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.

[patient] that was about six days ago now .

[doctor] okay . all right . um , and did you have any trauma before that happened ? were you doing anything strenuous like crossfit or lifting boxes or anything like that before you went for , for the walk ?
[patient] i have been lifting more , um , probably around three times a week . so i do n't know if it was because i was doing deadlifts that day and then walked .

[patient] um , maybe i was using my back more than my legs .
[doctor] okay . all right . and was it any particular area in your back ? was it the lower back ?
[patient] yeah , it was .
[doctor] okay . on one side versus the other ?
[patient] um , kind of both equally .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . all right . so on physical examination , you know , everything looks good . you know , on your heart exam , i do hear that slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur , but you've had that before . that seems stable to me . on your back exam , you do have some pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of your lumbar spine , and you do have pain with flexion and extension as well , and you have a negative straight leg raise . so what does that mean ? so we're going to go over that . okay ? let's ... let me look at some of your results , though , first . okay ?

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Cherry is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain. She has been walking a lot lately. She states that she was doing deadlifts that day and then walked. She does not know if it was because she was using her back more than her legs. She denies any numbness or tingling in her legs or feet. She notes that she has been watching her diet and everything has been good. She is taking lisinopril, which has been doing well. She reports that her back pain has been stable since 6 days ago, when she was walking. The patient denies any trauma prior to that time. She also denies any weakness in her lower extremities.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

• Musculoskeletal: No pain to palpation of the lower extremities. No erythema, tenderness, or edema of the back. No plantarflexion.

VITALS REVIEWED
• Neck: Supple without thyromegaly. No carotid bruits.


RESULTS

X-rays of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed today in office. These reveal no evidence of fracture or osteoarthritis. Mild effusion is present. No evidence of coronary artery disease.

Lipid panel: Elevated cholesterol.
Abdominal x-ray: Moderate effusion.
Echocardiogram: Within normal limits. Mild narrowing of the diaphragm space.
Non-melanoma skin panel: Moderate narrowing.
Skin panel: Glucose level is elevated.


X-ray of the lower extremities: Moderate.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN


Cheryl is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hypertension, who presents today with back pain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended lisinopril 800 mg twice daily for pain. She will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on her progress. I want to do a quick physical exam on her back to assess for any signs of degenerative disc disease. I also want to obtain a x-ray of the lower back to evaluate for any possible signs of a herniated disc. I will prescribe ibuprofen 500 mg once a day to help with the pain. If she continues to have pain, we may need to consider a cortisone injection.

virtassist,D2N096,"[doctor] um , hi mrs. anderson . right ?
[patient] yeah . yes , doctor .
[doctor] what brings you here today ?
[patient] hi , doctor . um , i'm having this left shoulder pain lately , uh , and it's paining a lot .
[doctor] okay . all right . hey , dragon . i am seeing mrs. anderson , a 44-years-old female , uh , complaining to check the left shoulder pain . um , so how long how has this lasted ?
[patient] it's been a week , doctor . yeah .
[doctor] a week .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] um , did you take any medication yourself ?
[patient] no , i did not take any pain medications . actually , i did . i did take a tylenol for two or three days , but then that did n't help at all . so , uh , the reason why it started or when it started to happen is-
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] . i was actually in gymnastics class .
[doctor] yeah , okay .
[patient] and , uh , i do n't know . maybe i must have toppled over into some weird position , so it started to pain since then , uh , because of a certain move .
[doctor] okay , uh-
[patient] i went overboard , i think . yeah .
[doctor] all right , lem me , uh , take a quick look . uh , can you move up a little bit ? yeah .
[patient] uh , yeah . in fact , that's hurts .
[doctor] does that- does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , it does .
[doctor] what if you move back a little bit ?
[patient] uh , that also hurts , doctor .
[doctor] yeah , okay .
[patient] any kind of movement on my left shoulder actually hurts .
[doctor] okay . all right , um , so let's ... hey , dragon . show me the last x-ray . all right , from the x-ray , it does n't look like there is any , uh , broken bone or fracture . my guess is you probably , um , hurt your joint , uh-
[patient] uh- .
[doctor] . a little bit .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week .
[patient] and for how long ? yes .
[doctor] for a week .
[patient] a week , okay .
[doctor] and then if you ... if it's still painful , you can use , uh , ice or , um , heat pad-
[patient] okay .
[doctor] . 'cause that might help relieve your pain .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um ...
[patient] but i wanted you to know that i did have past surgery on my , um , left arm-
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] . so , um , i hope that should n't matter , right ?

[patient] okay .
[doctor] . while it's healing .

[patient] okay . sure .
[doctor] but you should be fine-
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] . after just resting and regular pain reliever .
[patient] okay . all right .
[doctor] um-
[patient] should we take another x-ray when i come back , if the pain does n't improve ?
[doctor] um , maybe . let's see how you're doing in the next three weeks .
[patient] uh .

She states she was in gymnastics class and fell over. She believes she may have hurt her left shoulder. She is resting her left arm while it heals. She has a past surgical history of left arm surgery. She does not carry heavy weights or other obstructive devices. She will continue to use ibuprofen 3 times a day for a week, and if it is still painful, she will use ice or heat pad. The patient has a history of right arm surgery, so she hopes that does not contribute to her pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have recommended that she continue to use ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times a day for a week. She should continue to rest her left shoulder while the healing process takes place. She will follow up with me in 3 weeks to check on her progress. If her symptoms have not improved, we may need to consider further imaging.
• Medical Reasoning: The patient is a 44-year-old female who has had past surgery on her left arm. I believe this may be related to her recent left shoulder pain, but I do not know for sure.

[patient] yes , that's correct . it was icy , and i have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house . i stepped and my feet just went out . fell on my left side . seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt . it's been hurting since .
[doctor] yeah , that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms . anything seem to make the pain worse ?
[patient] well , i've always hit the gym and lifted weights . i've been trying to keep with my routine of two days a week , but it's been hard . the pain is worse when i lift , and i have n't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds which is very frustrating .
[doctor] mm-hmm . i can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine .
[patient] exactly . i really enjoy my exercise , but over the past one to two weeks , i've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just was n't worth it honestly . i do keep up with my walking , though . my wife and i walk about 30 minutes almost every day . we have done this since i retired from my office job last year .
[doctor] i do not blame you , mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ?
[patient] not too much . i have iced a bit , but i have not taken anything for the pain . stopping exercise and some ice has helped a bit , but it still hurts enough for me to come to see you .

[patient] so what are the possible treatments ?
[doctor] well , we have a few options you can try . first option would be to start with physical therapy . i would recommend two sessions per week as well as any other exercises they give you to do at home . we can start there and if that does n't improve your pain , then we could try a cortisone injection .
[patient] i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it does n't help . i am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first .
[doctor] all right . great . i'll get a referral order , and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled .

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left shoulder and elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joseph James is a new patient who presents today for evaluation of left shoulder pain. He fell 5 months ago going up a flight of stairs, and the pain has been present since. He states he has been having constant pain in his left shoulder and left elbow. He has been trying to keep with his routine of 2 days a week, but it has been hard. The pain is worse when he lifts, and he has not been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds which is very frustrating. He does keep up with his walking, however, as his wife and I walk about 30 minutes almost every day. He denies any numbness or tingling. The patient has iced a bit, but has not taken anything for the pain.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Respiratory
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Musculoskeletal
No pain to palpation of the left shoulder or elbow. No tenderness or tingling. No warmth. No erythema or deformity. Positive hawkins-kennedy and neer's test. Normal proximal and distar strength. Supple upper extremity strength. Normal median radial ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees. Normal empty tan.


RESULTS

X-ray of the left shoulder and left elbow is unremarkable. No fractures or dislocations are noted. No evidence of any fractures or osteoarthritis. Good bony alignment. No obvious signs of any fracture or arthritis.

Hemoglobin A1c is elevated at 7.3.
Abdominal x-ray is normal. No signs of fracture. No bony abrasion. No acute fractures noted.
Impression: Within normal limits. No separation of the radial ulnar bases. No fracture of the radius or ulnar bony bases. Positive hawkins-kennedy and neer's test.


ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder impingement syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him in regards to his current symptoms. I have recommended cortisone injection into his left shoulder and left elbow. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to start with physical therapy. I will also refer him to physical therapy if his symptoms do not improve over the next 2 weeks. At that point, we will discuss further treatment options, including physical therapy, home exercise, and possible medication.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient states that his symptoms have been consistent since he fell 5 months ago going up a flight of stairs. I believe this is the proximal proximal distal upper extremity of his right shoulder. I do not think there's an additional injury or issue with his wrist, but because everything is connected, you're experiencing pain in his wrist because of your shoulder. He states that he has not been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds at a time for the past 2 weeks due to his pain. I advised him to continue with his current exercise routine, but to limit his weight to 15 to 20 pounds. I also recommended that he"

[patient_guest] yes , but it's not barky .
[doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ?
[patient_guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .
[doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ?
[patient_guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .
[doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?
[patient_guest] yes , he did . yeah .
[doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?
[patient_guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] so , he varies i guess .
[doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ?
[patient_guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .
[doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ?
[patient_guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .
[doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ?
[patient_guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .
[doctor] thank you .
[patient_guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .
[doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ?
[patient_guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .
[doctor] good , good . that's a good choice .
[patient_guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .
[doctor] i see . and , any other medications ?
[patient_guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .
[doctor] okay . that's good .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?
[patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .
[doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ?
[patient_guest] no , i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps .
[patient_guest] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] can you take a big breath randy .
[patient_guest] where's mama ?
[doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .
[patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .
[doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over .
[patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good .
[doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .
[patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .
[doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .
[patient_guest] all right . thank you .
[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .
[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .
[doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .
[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?
[doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .
[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .
[doctor] yes , zarbee's .
[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?
[doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] right , does that make sense ?
[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .
[doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .
[patient_guest] right , okay .
[doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .
[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?
[doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , "" as needed , "" or anything like that .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?
[doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .
[doctor] so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .
[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .
[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?
[doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .
[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .
[doctor] you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .","

"
virtscribe,D2N101,"[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?
[patient] yes . that's right .
[doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?
[patient] no , i have n't .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ?
[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .
[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .
[patient] okay , that's reassuring .
[doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .
[patient] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?
[patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .
[doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?
[patient] most likely july .
[doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?
[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .
[doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?
[patient] i would say since i was in high school .
[doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .
[patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .
[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?
[patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .
[doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?
[patient] sometimes , yes .
[doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .
[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .
[doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?
[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .
[doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?
[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .
[doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?
[patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .
[doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?
[patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .
[doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um-
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?
[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .
[doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .
[patient] okay . that's fine .
[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .
[patient] right .
[doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .
[patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .
[patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .
[doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .
[patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .
[patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .
[doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .
[patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .
[doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .
[patient] good . i look forward to a relief .
[doctor] i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .
[patient] okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .
[doctor] okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that .
[patient] okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .
[doctor] that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia , presenting for evaluation of breast reduction . the patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments , but the minimal relief , and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty . her minimum required resection , based on a bsa of 2.65 , with the schnur scale is 1,792 grams , which should be attainable . given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above , there is potential for using a nipple graft .
[doctor] physical exam findings of breast , inspection reveals asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally . there is no nipple retraction or discharge bilaterally . no breast tenderness , masses , or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable .","

New breast reduction consult.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Jones is a new patient who presents today for a breast reduction consultation. She has been going to the chiropractor for a few years for back pain.

virtscribe,D2N102,"[doctor] kelly wood . date of birth , february 15th , 1979 . established patient here for renal ultrasound because of hematuria . urine dipstick today . negative for leukocytes , nitrates , protein , ketone , bilirubin and glucose . color yellow and clear , urobilinogen 0.2 , ph 5.5 and specific gravity 1.020 . there is a trace amount of blood in the urine and intact . renal ultrasound impression . right kidney is 10 cm in length by five centimeter wide . there are no stones , masses or hydronephrosis . the left kidney is 10.8 centimeters in length and five centimeters wide . there is a six millimeter left renal stone non-obstructing . 533 milliliters pre-void and 0 milliliters post-void . hi , mrs. wood . i see you're just finished your ultrasound .
[patient] yes , ma'am .
[doctor] well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything .
[patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .
[doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine .
[patient] um , at the time , i'd say an eight .
[doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ?
[patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .
[doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ?
[patient] that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time .
[patient] i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .
[doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions .
[patient] yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .
[doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day .
[patient] so , if i weight 250 pounds , i should drink ?
[doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew .
[patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?
[doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork .
[patient] what's oxalate ?
[doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products .
[patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .
[doctor] great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid .
[patient] okay , good . i like to have things in writing to help me remember .
[doctor] perfect . well , if you have any more questions . if you do n't have any more questions , you're all set . i wo n't need to see you back until next year , as long as you do n't have any more issues like bleeding or pain . if you do have any issues , you can always call the office sooner . and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine , you should go to the emergency room .
[patient] all right . well , let's hope we do n't have to do either of those and i see you next year .
[doctor] yes , let's hope . come right this way and i'll walk you to check out . update pe abdomen . no flank pain . anti gu . normal vaginal exam . primary diagnosis is hematuria . secondary diagnosis is chronic urol ... urolithiasis . thank you . this completes mrs. wood encounter .","

Genitourinary
- Examination of the right kidney: Trace amount of blood in the urine. No masses, masses, or hydronephrosis. There is a six millimeter left renal stone non-obstructing. No pain.


RESULTS

Renal ultrasound images of the right and left kidneys were obtained and reviewed today. There are no stones, masses or hydronephrosis. The left kidney is 10.8 centimeters in length and five centimeters wide. There is a six millimeter left renal stone non-obstructing. The blood in the urine was due to the kidney stones.

Abdominal x-ray of the abdomen is unremarkable. No evidence of any fractures or osteoarthritis. The right kidney is not dilated.
Skin panel is normal. No obvious signs of kidney disease.
Echocardiogram demonstrates the presence of kidney stone.


ASSESSMENT

Left kidney non-obstructing renal stone.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have recommended that she avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein. She should drink about half of her body weight in ounces of water a day and reduce the amount of beef, poultry, fish, and pork she eats. She is to follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on her progress. If her symptoms do not improve, I will consider performing a lithotripsy of the left kidney.

virtscribe,D2N103,"[doctor] next patient is melissa sanchez . date of birth , 9/23/1962 . mrn : 5484367 . she is being seen in office today for status post mitral valve repair done on 8/3/2020 . at her previous follow-up on 9/17 , we felt that she was doing quite well from a cardiac standpoint , and so we recommended she continue with the same medication . ecg taken on 12/26/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response . t-wave inversion anteriorly . compared to the previous study , there are no significant changes , and please add in the history , patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation , history of diabetes , asthma , and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease .
[doctor] ms. sanchez , it's good to see you again .
[patient] yeah , it's good seeing you too dr. hughes . you look like you're doing well .
[doctor] i am , thank you . you too . you're looking great . how have you been feeling ?
[patient] pretty good . i'm definitely feeling better , thank goodness . i was having a rough time before surgery , um , but i think i'm overall pretty good now though .
[doctor] okay . well , that's really good to hear . i'm glad . are you having any new symptoms right now ?
[patient] no , not really . but , you know , i'm still getting some chest pains sometimes , and my breathing gets shallow . but , i guess i'm learning what i can and ca n't do . uh , so if i feel like that , if i'm , like , exerting myself , i slow down a bit which helps , and then when i go back to it later , i can usually finish whatever i was doing .
[doctor] okay . so , it does go away though ? how long does an episode seem to last ?
[patient] uh , only a few minutes i guess . then it disappears for a while . it's weird .
[doctor] what is a while ?
[patient] it goes away for a couple weeks . um , so when it happens , i just take the day nice and slow , i do n't push myself .
[doctor] okay . so , maybe it's a couple times a month you feel this way ?
[patient] yeah , just often enough for me to notice .
[doctor] understood . okay . are you taking your medications regularly ?
[patient] uh- . i've been trying to keep up with that . there's a lot of extra pills now , but i have a reminder app , so i do pretty well .
[doctor] okay . that's great . and so , you're taking coumadin , right ?
[patient] yeah , also lasix and the atenolol .
[doctor] are you having any side effects from the medications at all ?
[patient] not really . uh , i notice that the atenolol is making me irritable in the beginning , but i guess i've gotten used to it , does n't seem to bother me as much now .
[doctor] okay . well , that sounds good . sounds like you're well on the mend . so , why do n't i start out , um , with the physical exam , and just check you out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you're going to hear me describe things in detail or repeat things as i go to reference later for my notes .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay then . i'm going to be using my status post template , ms. sanchez , please lie down on the table here and we'll get started . all right . can you turn your head to the left . head and neck no jvd detected . you can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please . okay , that's good . and lungs have reduced breath , but auscultation and percussion are clear . okay . breath normally , i'm just going to listen to your heart . rhythm is irregularly irregular .
[patient] that's a funny statement . what does that mean ?
[doctor] yeah , it does sounds kind of weird , right ? it's when your heart does n't beat with the correct rhythm , and whatever rhythm it does n't have a pattern to it . so , it's part of the atrial fibrillation .
[patient] wow , that sounds like a mess .
[doctor] yeah , it's not ideal . but , many people have a-fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes .
[patient] agh , i see . that's good to know .
[doctor] okay . so , s1 slightly accentuated , no s3 . i'm going to touch your belly , and does any of that hurt .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] how about there ? and your feet ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay , great . and trace peripheral edema on extremities . all right ms. sanchez , you can sit up now . so , it looks like your heart valves are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely .
[patient] good .
[doctor] yes . we are , we looked at your ecg taken earlier today , and we are seeing the a-fib , but it's being well controlled with the medicine , and you're taking coumadin , four milligrams , lasix at four milligrams a day , and the atenolol , you're taking that every day as well , right ?
[patient] yes . the 50 milligrams every day .
[doctor] great . it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery .
[patient] great .
[doctor] so , let's continue on your current meds . i'm glad that you're figuring out what your body can handle . definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help .
[patient] i'll do my best .
[doctor] and that's about it . do you have any questions for me ?
[patient] um , i do . when do i need to come back and get checked out ?
[doctor] well , i do n't think you need to come back soon . everything from a cardio perspective is fine . so , i think let's do a followup in about six to nine months .
[patient] all right , thank you . it was good to see you again dr. hughes .
[doctor] you as well ms. sanchez , do take care .

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Atrial Fibrillation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Melissa Sanchez is a 62-year-old female who presents today for a status post mitral valve repair evaluation. She is being seen in office today for status post her previous follow-up on 9/17. The patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation, history of diabetes, asthma, and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease. She has been taking Coumadin, Lasix, and Atenolol. She reports that she has been trying to keep up with her medications and has been doing pretty well. She notes that she is still getting some chest pains sometimes, and her breathing gets shallow. She states that it goes away for a couple of weeks. She denies any new symptoms right now, but notes that it does go away after a few minutes. She continues to take her medications regularly and has a reminder app on her phone for her medications. She does not have any side effects from the medications at the moment, but has noticed that the atenololin is making her irritable in the beginning, but she has gotten used
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
• Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Tenderness to palpation of the right lower extremity.

• Musculoskeletal: No jugular venous distention. No thyromegaly. No lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits. No erythema of the bilateral lower extremities. No hematoma. No extra heart sounds.


RESULTS

ECG taken on 12/26/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response. T-wave inversion anteriorly. Normal sinus rhythm. No evidence of mitral regurgitation or coronary artery disease.

Mitral valve repair performed on 8/3/2020. Mitral valve replacement performed on 9/17/2021. At her previous follow-up, we felt that she was doing quite well from a cardiac standpoint, and so we recommended she continue with the same medication.
Rapid strep test performed on 11/24/2020 demonstrates decreased ejection fraction and decreased diastolic filling. Normal R wave progression. No coronary artery pathology.


ASSESSMENT

Atrial fibrillation post mitral valve repair.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with her in regards to her current symptoms. I have recommended that she continue with her current medications, lasix and atenolol, as prescribed. She will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on her progress. At that point, we will discuss further treatment options, including a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation. We discussed the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including limiting alcohol consumption, smoking, and physical activity. I also advised her to continue taking her medications as prescribed, and to keep an eye on her blood pressure.

[patient] i'm doing good , thank you . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm great , thanks . so how have you been since the last time ? i know the last time we were talking about decreasing your prednisone dose , correct ?
[patient] yes . i'm just on one now and that seems to be enough .
[doctor] aw , that's great to hear .
[patient] yeah , there were a couple days there i took an extra one , just because there was a little extra pain in my feet . and i do have a desk job , so when i have a day off where i'm moving around a lot they do tend to hurt a bit more .
[doctor] okay . how many times did you do that ?
[patient] um , it was n't often , maybe once a week .
[doctor] okay . so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone . we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit . and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ?
[patient] yeah , definitely . because i went to get my covid shots , um , but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy . so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot .
[doctor] okay . and what happened ?
[patient] i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later .
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that . and- and what did you do about the second dose ?
[patient] well , i called into the hotline because i was in so much pain with the first one . and they said , "" no , just go ahead and take it , "" so i did .
[doctor] okay . that's good then . we do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high-risk medication . do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time ?
[patient] no , they did n't give me one .
[doctor] okay . so we can do that for you too . uhm , so what questions do you have for me , judy ?
[patient] well , i just wanted to know why i was getting all these bruises here , so like when i bump myself . i do n't know where they're coming from .
[doctor] okay . that's probably from the prednisone , it can increase bruising .
[patient] okay . i did n't know that . um , i do n't even feel it when it happens , they just show up .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately that can happen , but we're working on discontinuing that so let's see if the bruises do go away .
[patient] okay . that sounds good , thanks .
[doctor] okay , judy , please , um , sit up here and i'll take a look . shoes and socks off please .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . let me see here . okay . so where is it hurting ? in your joints right here ?
[patient] yeah , a little . also in my feet joints as well .
[doctor] okay . and how about when you bend the knee like this ?
[patient] well , it hurt before we increased the methotrexate , but it's doing pretty good now .
[doctor] okay , good . can you flex your toes please ? good range of motion . also ridges in nails , that's from the psoriasis .
[patient] yeah . they've been like that for a long time now .
[doctor] okay . all right , uhm , ms gomez , it looks like we're moving along with your treatment nicely . we'll stop your prednisone and continue with the methotrexate . make sure to stop by the front desk and make an appointment for the blood work , and i'll see you in three months .

CHIEF COMPLAINT

PAST HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Gomez is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents today for an evaluation of ongoing management of psoriatic arthritis. She is currently on a single dose of prednisone, which has been decreasing since her last visit. She notes that she has a desk job, so when she is moving around a lot, her feet tend to hurt a bit more. She has been taking an extra dose of methotrexate for a couple of days because there was a little extra pain in her feet. She denies any bruising.

The patient reports that she was getting bruises on her hands and feet when she bumps herself. She does not know where they are coming from. She states that they have been like that for a long time. She believes that they are probably from the Prednisone and is working on discontinuing that. The patient notes that the bruises have been there for a while, but she does not even feel them when they happen. She reports that they usually happen once a week, but notes that they could be more frequent if she is working a lot. She also denies bruising on her nails, which could be from
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

• Cardiovascular: No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.

• Musculoskeletal: Mild pain to palpation of the right knee. Good range of motion. No plantarflexion or dorsiflexion.

VITALS REVIEWED

Neck: No jugular vein distension. No carotid bruits. No thyromegaly.


RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee is unremarkable. Good range of motion. No fractures or osteoarthritis.

Skin panel: Within normal limits. Mild to moderate psoriasis. Good rheumatoid arthritis prognosis. Good chondromalacia. Mild-to-moderate fibromyalgia. Mild arthritis progression.


X-rays of the left knee and right ankle are unremarkable, no fractures or arthritis. Good arthritis prognostication. Mild rheumatism. Mild psoriatic arthritis pathology.
Attributes: Moderate to moderate.
Abdominal spondylitis.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN


1. Psoriatic arthritis.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended that we discontinue the prednisone and continue with methotrexate. She will follow up with me in 3 months for a blood draw to check on her levels. We discussed the risks associated with this medication, including the possibility of side effects, such as increased bruising. I also advised her that it is possible that her bruises could be caused by the increased dose of metotrexate, which is a high-risk medication for psoriasis. I advised her to keep an eye on her bruising and to contact me if she experiences any more.

virtscribe,D2N105,"[doctor] patient's name is diana scott . date of birth , 12/8/1920 . the date of service is 7/9/2021 . this is a new patient note .
[doctor] good afternoon . how are you today ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?
[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .
[doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?
[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .
[doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?
[patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .
[doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?
[patient] no , i definitely do n't .
[doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?
[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .
[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?
[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .
[doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?
[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .
[doctor] got it . all right .
[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .
[doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?
[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .
[doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?
[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .
[doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?
[patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .
[doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?
[patient] i do n't notice it at all .
[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?
[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .
[doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ?
[patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .
[doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?
[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay .
[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .
[doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?
[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .
[doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?
[patient] i'm not really sure .
[doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?
[patient] yeah , you name it .
[doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?
[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .
[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .
[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam .
[patient] all right . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?
[patient] no , i feel fine .
[doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .
[patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .
[doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .
[patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .
[doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .
[patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .
[doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] and then , it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will pr- , um , defer to your pcp . however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs , and given your age and no history of coronary artery d- , artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin .
[patient] really ?
[doctor] yeah , um , possibly . he would have to evaluate you , but it is certainly something to discuss with him . so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . and then , um , lastly , your hyperthyroidism , uh , i see you're taking levothyroxine . and again , no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have them .
[patient] okay , i will .
[doctor] all right . so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps . um , and we'll , uh , take care of your echocardiogram today . um , any questions ?
[patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . and i think it looks good .
[doctor] okay , awesome . all right . well , have a good rest of your day , and we'll see you soon .
[doctor] for physical exam , constitutional elderly otherwise no acute distress . cardiovascular normal s1 and s2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm . there is a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with , uhm , mild radiation to the carotids . neurologic gait is normal for age .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , probably one cardiac murmur . diana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids . this is most likely representative of aortic stenosis , for symptoms could be due to severe aortic , aortic stenosis . however , her s2 is relatively preserved , which would be more consistent with , consistent with moderate . some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction , so it is possible she , she did have an echocardiogram at some point in the past . she does not appear significantly volume overloaded today .
[doctor] her next problem is pvcs . her referral mentioned tachycardia . uh , her ekg today shows sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs , as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern . she does not have any significant palpitations and we will check an echocardiogram to assess overa- overall cardiac structure and function . depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis , we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation , or further , possibly a heart mon- monitor to assess overall burden of the pvcs . at this point , she's asymptomatic , so we will start with the echocardiogram only .
[doctor] her next problem , hypolipidemia , is managed by her pcp . due to bilateral leg pain over the last month , considered tavr evaluation following echocardiogram . statin could be indicated .
[doctor] and next problem , lightheadedness , dizziness . she is on meclizine for this . it is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness is related to the aorta stenosis , and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above . pvcs on her ekg could be contributing , but she does not feel palpitations . we will consider a monitor , but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above . follow up three to four weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps . end of dictation .","
CHIEF COMPLAINT

New patient note.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Diana Scott is a pleasant 91-year-old female who presents today for the evaluation of a new worrisome heart murmur. The patient was referred by her primary care physician. She states that she has severe pains in her legs and has been taking pain pills for them for approximately 1 month. She denies any chest pain or shortness of breath. She also denies any dizziness or lightheadedness. She does, however, feel short of breath if she walks too fast or if she tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. She has a walker and uses it to get around the house. She reports that her legs have been severe for about a month now. She notes that she does not feel lightheaded or dizzy at all. She is taking a pain pill for her legs when it does get bad, but does not take it every day. She rates her pain as 70% to 80% worse than 6 months ago, and estimates that her pain has decreased by 70% from 6 months to 80%. She does not notice any changes in her heart rate or irregular heartbeats, but she does notice

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

The patient reports that he has been feeling short of breath for some time. He has noticed that for some reason his breathing is not what it used to be. He states that he catches his breath a lot more than he used to and that he is not quite sure why. The last time it happened, he went to the urgent care and they prescribed him an inhaler that he uses now when he feels the symptoms coming on. He denies any rash on his body. He also denies any lip or throat swelling. The patient has a dog that eyes water like that she always gets eyebugers. He is not a big cat person and denies any allergies in the past.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Mild expiratory wheezing bilaterally. No audible stridor.

Cardiovascular
- Grade 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds. No rubs, rales, or rhonchi. No carotid bruits. No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. No erythema. No cellulitis. No skin thickening. No edema. No angioedema.


RESULTS

X-rays of the chest were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no evidence of asthma. There is no angioedema which is just swelling of your lips like you mentioned in your previous interview. There was no audible stridor which is a bad noise in your airway when it gets swollen so that's good news if you just want to take a deep breath listening to your lungs on your lungs exam. The pulse ox is normal and the pulmonary function test is both normal.

Pulmonary function test: Normal.
Abdominal x-ray: Within normal limits.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN


1. Asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with symptoms consistent with asthma.

- Patient Education and Counseling: I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended that we obtain a chest x-ray and pulmonary function test to evaluate for asthma. We will also start him on a nebulizer that he can use when he feels short of breath. He will continue to use albuterol 10 mg once a day as needed to help with his breathing. I also recommended that he use a recording device to help me with my documentation is that okay with you

INSTRUCTIONS

aci,D2N107,"[doctor] so bryan it's nice to see you again in the office today what's going on
[patient] i was in my yard yesterday and i was raking leaves and i felt fine and then when i got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and i started getting pins and needles in my right foot
[doctor] alright have you ever had this type of back pain before
[patient] i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day
[doctor] okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing
[patient] put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help
[doctor] okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing
[patient] yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit
[doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately
[patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity
[doctor] yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt
[patient] it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes
[doctor] okay how about when you stand back up
[patient] no pain
[doctor] okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that
[patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts
[doctor] okay and and what's your relationship
[patient] partners
[doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up
[patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am
[doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is
[patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts
[doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury
[patient] no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't
[doctor] okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back
[patient] i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him
[doctor] that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands
[patient] can you repeat that
[doctor] if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back
[patient] i
[doctor] alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg
[patient] that would be my right leg
[doctor] okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before
[patient] i have not taken meloxicam
[doctor] alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan
[patient] it sounds reasonable
[doctor] alright
[patient] i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it
[doctor] alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi
Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Musculoskeletal
- Auscultation of Abdomen: Normal dorsiflexion and ROM. No pain on extension or flexion.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination: No pain to palpation right around the l5. Tenderness in the right lower extremity. Normal pulses in all extremities. Range of motion is normal. No plantarflexion or dorsal piriformis tenderness.


RESULTS

X-rays of the lower back were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of any fracture or dislocations. The lumbar spine is in good shape. There is some mild effusion around the l5 and L4 joints. The dorsal aspect of the spine is normal. There are no fractures or osteoarthritis present.

The x-rays reveal normal bony alignment of the L4, L5, L6, and R5 vertebral bases. The C5 vertebrae are within normal limits. The L6 vertebral spine is also in good alignment.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN


1. Low back pain.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient reports that his back pain is consistent with a low back sprain.

- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the nature of the diagnosis and treatment options today. I advised the patient to rest his back for the next 2 to 3 days. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve, we will discuss further treatment options including physical therapy and possible epidural steroid injections. I also advised him to discontinue the use of Tylenol 800 mg as well as Advil 800 mg for pain. He should continue to take ibuprofen 500 mg twice a day as needed to help with the pain. We will also refer him to physical therapy to help strengthen his lower back and strengthen his quadriceps. If he continues to have pain, we may need to consider spinal fusion surgery.

aci,D2N108,"[doctor] hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it
[patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed
[doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden
[patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach
[doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics
[patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet
[doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you
[patient] i do n't recall the name exactly
[doctor] do n't recall alright
[patient] something i had taken it before
[doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot
[patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance
[doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt
[patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had that before
[doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled
[patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time
[doctor] okay do you
[patient] i'm not really sure how
[doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it
[patient] i think they told me it was around ten
[doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt
[patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct
[doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening
[patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me
[doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound
[patient] that sounds great
[doctor] alright do you have any other question
[patient] i do if anything happens in between
[doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks

[doctor] okay and how long have you had the wound
[patient] about two to three weeks
[doctor] okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot
[patient] no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and
[doctor] okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot
[patient] yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though
[doctor] okay now does it hurt
[patient] no i ca n't feel it
[doctor] okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines
[patient] no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when i put a band-aid on
[doctor] okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem
[patient] no i'm upset
[doctor] i'm so upset too i love those shoes
[patient] no i'm so upset i i love those shoes
[doctor] okay so what kind of shoes are they
[patient] they're hoka's
[doctor] ah so where did you get them
[patient] i got them at rei couple of years ago
[doctor] they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so what do you like about them
[patient] they are comfortable they are easy to take on and off and they provide good stability
[doctor] that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing
[patient] i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight
[doctor] okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here
[patient] no it's okay
[doctor] okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright do you have any other questions
[patient] no
[doctor] okay","

[patient] my right
[doctor] okay your right knee and so based on like your inside and outside which part hurts more
[patient] it's kind of the outside of the knee
[doctor] alright so the lateral aspect not a problem and you said that you heard a pop when you landed right
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] just tylenol
[doctor] alright so did the tylenol help
[patient] not really
[doctor] okay alright and so hmmm when does it have you tried anything else like did you ice it use heat anything like that
[patient] no i just kinda elevated it and that was about it
[doctor] okay that's fine and how long ago did this happen
[patient] a week ago
[doctor] okay alright so you put up with the pain for a week that's i'm proud of you for that
[patient] i do n't like to come to the doctors
[doctor] excuse me i feel rejected right now why why would you say something like that it's fine but you know i i like it when you're not here either because that means that you're doing a good job so let's see about like getting your knee fixed up but i want to talk about some of the other issues that you have first so we know that you have hypertension right and i discussed maybe you getting a blood pressure cuff because i needed you to measure those a bit more regularly did you get the cuff
[patient] what no
[doctor] no okay that's fine have you measured your blood pressure recently at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay are you still taking your medication because i see you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril
[patient] yeah most days i remember
[doctor] okay
[patient] ra i'm not suspicious but we're just gon na go with that okay because looking at your vitals it it is of still a bit high i'm not really comfortable i see like a hundred and eighty over you know eighty and
[doctor] that's not where we wan na be so i wonder if we might need to adjust your medication but let's talk about your diabetes how are your blood sugars
[patient] i think they're little bit better
[doctor] okay what makes you think that have you been taking them
[patient] yeah i check it you know most days again kinda when i remember
[doctor] okay how often are you checking it
[patient] i would say four five times a week
[doctor] okay you might wan na switch to maybe two or three times a day but you know that's something i'm glad that you are measuring are you taking your metformin
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and then i think we have you on five hundred milligrams correct
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright how is your diet
[patient] kinda the same as my exercise decent could be better
[doctor] alright and okay not a problem so what is your do you are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros are you just eating what you feel like
[patient] yeah just trying to watch what i eat more than anything but nothing specific
[doctor] okay and are you do you know if you're particularly focused on your salt like is it like a low salt diet
[patient] no just trying to watch my carbs a little bit more but not counting or anything
[doctor] alright so like is it a specific diet i just wan na make sure like are you on like the keto diet
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt
[patient] little bit
[doctor] okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] alright can you bend your knee and straighten it
[patient] i can i think that's all i can i can bend
[doctor] mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight
[patient] i can but i have a little bit of a limp
[doctor] okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars but i think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and i also wan na order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well do you have any questions
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] alright awesome","

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture, however, his right knee does appear to be contorted in a way that is causing him pain. We discussed that this could be related to his recent trampoline accident and that he heard a pop and instant pain when he landed. I advised him to continue taking Tylenol 500 mg every 4 to 5 hours as needed to help with the pain. I also advised him that if his symptoms do not improve over the next couple of days, we may need to consider a change in his medication. He understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

aci,D2N112,"[doctor] hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today
[patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse
[doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there
[patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time
[doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version
[patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden
[doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at
[patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month
[doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes
[patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here
[doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me
[patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg
[doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life
[patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten
[doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better
[patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today
[doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs
[patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well
[doctor] that's okay
[patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day
[doctor] absolutely
[patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them
[doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here
[patient] no it's right here
[doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there
[patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks
[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please
[patient] okay that's it that's all i got
[doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan
[patient] sure sounds good
[doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you","

ASSESSMENT

Lower back pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are consistent with a herniated disc in his lower back. He understands and agrees with me that this is a common issue for patients who have had back pain for a long time. We discussed that the most important thing for me to capture is that the pain is in the hip side of the leg and that it radiates down the whole leg. I also advised him that if his symptoms do not improve over the next couple of days, I will refer him to physical therapy to help strengthen his lower extremities. I advised him to avoid sitting or standing for long periods of time and to use a cane when he is seated. He was advised to take Motrin every 6 to 8 hours as needed to help with his pain. The patient was also advised to discontinue use of the cane and use a walker for the next 2 to 3 days. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress."

[patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri
[doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri
[patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about
[doctor] okay
[patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here
[doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal
[doctor] okay go ahead sorry
[patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me
[doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery
[patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment
[doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week
[patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri
[doctor] okay alright thank you bye
[patient] bye sorry","

She notes that she has tried to exercise more in order to lose weight, but she notes that her headaches are worse when she is exercising. She reports that she is starting to get blurred vision in the right side of her vision, which she states is not all the time but it will come and go but some blurred like on the left side. The patient denies any other symptoms when she exercises. She is a runner and uses Nike shoes for her running.

Cardiovascular
- Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, normal rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the Brain: Normal cranial nerves. No effusion, edema, or edema of the bilateral lower extremities. The funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye.

ASSESSMENT

Headache.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her headaches have been getting worse over the past few months and that they appear to be related to her increased activity. We discussed the nature of her headaches, as well as her history of headaches, and I have recommended that we obtain a MRI of the brain to rule out any signs of a brain tumor. She will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review the results of the MRI. At that point, we may need to discuss further treatment options such as a corticosteroid injection or an epidural steroid injection. I also advised her that if her headaches do not improve over the next 2 weeks, we will consider a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. The patient understands and agrees with the recommended treatment plan.

[doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before
[patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so
[doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not
[patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it
[doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go
[patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain
[doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also
[patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so
[doctor] okay
[patient] of course
[doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that
[patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it
[doctor] okay and does that seem to help or
[patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit
[doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and
[patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift
[doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or
[patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of
[doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan
[patient] no that sounds good
[doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay
[patient] sounds great
[doctor] okay thanks
[patient] thanks
[doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or
[patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but
[doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that
[patient] okay that sounds like a plan that sounds good","

[doctor] hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right
[patient] yes
[doctor] boy my gosh yeah those are the best so those are those are deadly do n't tell my cardiologist so okay so listen you know i see that we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams once a day no actually last visit we increased it so i've got you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day correct you're still taking that
[patient] yes twice a day
[doctor] okay and but your blood sugars are a bit off you know maybe those the cadberry eggs so how about your asthma how has that been doing you know have you had any asthma attacks you're still taking flovent twice a day and the albuterol as needed
[patient] yeah knock on wood i my asthma is pretty much under control
[doctor] okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct
[patient] that's correct yes
[doctor] okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct
[patient] yes that's right
[doctor] okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you
[patient] kills
[doctor] okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you
[patient] yeah it hurts a little bit
[doctor] okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever
[patient] no i do n't think so
[doctor] okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me
[patient] it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it
[doctor] yeah yeah well
[patient] i'm not i'm not young anymore
[doctor] yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime

[patient] i have n't seen one in a while but yes i saw someone maybe a year ago
[doctor] okay so yeah i know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones so i definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also wan na do some labs as well
[patient] okay
[doctor] so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc
[patient] hmmm

[doctor] okay maybe you have a little white coat syndrome some of my patients do have it i have it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy
[patient] okay
[doctor] that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control
[patient] yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know
[doctor] okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietitian be able to help you out
[patient] yeah i do n't know i do n't know if i can make another appointment i just add to the extra
[doctor] okay
[patient] less time to make food so
[doctor] yeah yeah definitely understand
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] alright yeah so i mean that's one thing we just got ta work one is your diet we try to keep you at least just twenty three hundred milligrams or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred milligrams of metformin daily now have you been taking that as well

[doctor] okay so i'm looking here i think last after your last visit you got a1c now was six . seven so it's a little bit high it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the type two diabetes a year ago so i'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam on you before i do just wan na make sure are you having any chest pain today
[patient] no
[doctor] alright any any belly pain
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so i'm gon na listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles listen to your heart so on your heart exam i do hear that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and we already knew about that previously so it has n't gotten any worse so that's good so i'm gon na just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones does that hurt

[patient] okay
[doctor] alright we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is is cleared up i also want to give you a referral to referral referral to urology

aci,D2N119,"[doctor] hey betty how are you doing
[patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms
[patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since
[doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems
[patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department
[doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now
[patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work
[doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or
[patient] yes yes that's the name of it
[doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that
[patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well
[doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs
[patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs
[doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep
[patient] yeah for the most part
[doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er
[patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then
[doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those
[patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone
[doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing
[patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days
[doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation
[patient] probably about a month ago
[doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center
[patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again
[doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis
[patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana
[doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all
[patient] hmmm hmmm
[doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that
[patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i do n't try to go there often
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam
[patient] okay
[doctor] now i reviewed your vitals for today and your your blood pressure is good it's one twenty eight over eighty two your respiratory rate is sixteen and your oxygen saturation is ninety nine percent on room air which is a good thing i'm gon na take a listen to your heart here your heart is regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any ectopic beats or and i do n't hear anything like rubs murmurs or gallops which is good so i'm gon na go take and listen to your lungs here on your lung exam i do appreciate some diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze and that's bilaterally so i hear that on both sides i'm gon na go do a quick neck exam here neck is supple trachea is midline i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy taking a listen here i do n't appreciate any carotid bruit now i'm also gon na take a look at your hands here i note strong bilateral pulses i do n't appreciate any clubbing on any of your fingertips which is which is important and i also note brisk capillary refill i'm gon na go ahead and review the results of your pulmonary function test that i had you do when you came into the office today and reviewing those results i do see that they are consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma so lem me go ahead and tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so now for your first problem of asthma your symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate or i'm sorry moderate moderate intermittent asthma and it's gon na be really important for us to be consistent with your inhaled inhaled steroid inhaler so i'm gon na need you to take that as prescribed and that's really gon na help cut down on those daily symptoms and needing to use that rescue inhaler that albuterol inhaler as frequently so the more you take and more consistently you take your inhaled steroid inhaler the less you will use your albuterol now it's not a fast acting inhaler like your albuterol but what is important is as going to be what helps you long term now if you do have an acute exacerbation so if you're having an acute issue with your breathing i do want you to continue to use your albuterol inhaler one to two puffs and then i want you to wait and see how your breathing is before you would take an additional one to two puffs we hope you have less of those acute exacerbations as you continue to use your inhaled steroid i'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you and that's gon na help us look at your symptoms see where your your pain points can be you know like those being having issues with with cats or dust that type of thing and we'll work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthma action plan so do you have any questions comments or concerns otherwise i will see you in thirty days

Pulmonary function is normal.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with exacerbation of her asthma.

- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that her symptoms are consistent with asthma exacerbation. I encouraged her to start taking albuterol 2 puffs twice a day as well as a prednisone taper pack to help with her breathing. I also advised her to be careful with her smoking and to avoid tobacco. She should also avoid going outside and walking and do those type of activities that can trigger her asthma exacerbations. She was advised to use her inhaler 2 times a day and to use a lidocaine inhaler when she wakes up in the middle of the night to help relieve her symptoms. We also discussed the importance of smoking cessation and that she should avoid tobacco for the next 6 months until she has a clean bill of health. I advised the patient to continue her current inhaler regimen. She will follow up with me in 6 months to check on how she is doing and if she needs to start a new inhaler.
2. Additional Testing: We will order an echocardiogram to evaluate for asthma nodules or other possible signs.

aci,D2N120,"[doctor] hello larry how are you doing today
[patient] i've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that i've been having for a couple of years now
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i have tried so many things and just nothing seems to work
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially
[patient] you know i never fell or was in an accident but i do remember it all happened like i started having back pain after i was moving furniture one weekend
[doctor] okay and now can you describe the pain for me
[patient] yeah it feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down even down to my right leg sometimes all the way down to my toe it feels like my big toe
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i also feel like i just ca n't get comfortable which is worse when i sit down okay yeah
[doctor] okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain
[patient] yeah i do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot
[doctor] okay
[patient] let me separate these
[doctor] and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area
[patient] no nothing like that
[doctor] okay now do you have any weakness
[patient] i would n't say i have any weakness no
[doctor] okay do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels
[patient] no
[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you you have some tried tried some things in the past so tell me what were they
[patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery
[doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like
[patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years
[doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf
[patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right
[patient] exactly
[doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions
[patient] no i ca n't recall any family members
[doctor] okay alright and do you smoke
[patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago
[doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit
[patient] okay that's painful
[doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that
[patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time
[doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright sounds good
[doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection

ASSESSMENT

1. Lumbar paravertebral degenerative disk disease.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are consistent with a lumbar disk disease of the type called L4-L5 disk. She will follow up with me in 2 weeks to review the results of her MRI and epidural steroid injection. I will also prescribe her a corticosteroid injection to treat her pain. I also advised her to take a quick cortilol injection to her ankles to help strengthen her ankles and lower her back. We discussed the risks associated with this procedure and the benefits of avoiding surgery. She understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway
[doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked
[patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days
[doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing
[patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it
[doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] no just the swelling and the pain
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day
[doctor] okay and
[patient] putting a cold pack on it
[doctor] okay and has that helped at all
[patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though
[doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here
[patient] i had my tonsils out
[doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press
[patient] yeah that's sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt
[patient] yeah do n't do that anymore
[doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan
[doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions
[patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me
[doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye
[patient] thank you","

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are consistent with a right knee medial collateral ligament strain. He has been placed on Lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day and has been instructed to take anti-inflammatories twice a day to help with the pain. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. I advised him that if his symptoms do not improve over the next 2 weeks, we will consider an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible fracture. I also advised him to discontinue the use of Tylenol 800 mg once a day as well as ibuprofen 500 mg once daily as needed for pain. The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[doctor] yeah
[patient] and yeah i've been having trouble walking and it just does n't feel solid really stable which is a problem i i recently got back into working out and i had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i do n't want to disrupt that moments on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so
[doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way
[patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys
[doctor] good good to hear alright well let's take a look at that ankle it looks like it's pretty swollen so let me just do a quick exam on that right now alright so looks like the outside of your ankle if i push on that does that hurt pretty bad

Electrocardiogram of the lateral ankle was obtained today and reviewed in office today. It demonstrates a displaced lisfranc joint with some bony degeneration.


ASSESSMENT

Right ankle displaced lateral malleolus.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays do not reveal any evidence of a medial or posterior malleolar fracture. Based on the position of his ankle, however, I do believe that he will require surgery to stabilize his ankle. We discussed the procedure options and the risks associated with this procedure. He will follow up with me in 3 months to check on his progress. If his symptoms do not improve, we may need to consider a second opinion.

aci,D2N125,"[patient] miss edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain this is a 54 -year-old male
[doctor] how're you doing doctor cruz nice to see you today
[patient] good to see you mister edwards i'm doctor
[doctor] tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you
[patient] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that
[doctor] had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area
[patient] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face
[doctor] not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face
[patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face
[doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it
[patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes
[doctor] sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it
[patient] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you
[doctor] pain excess
[patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work
[doctor] but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon
[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain
[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes
[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know
[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different
[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten
[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you
[patient] sure
[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth
[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that
[doctor] yep
[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay
[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal
[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp
[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia
[patient] okay
[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it
[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin
[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve
[patient] okay
[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first
[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve
[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this
[patient] sure
[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic
[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you
[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it
[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain
[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not
[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up
[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there
[patient] great i'll see you then
[doctor] alright","

ASSESSMENT

Right cheek bone pain.

PLAN

Mr. Edwards is a 54-year-old male who presents for evaluation of facial pain. He states that he has been experiencing stabbing pain in his right cheek bone right in that cheek bone area for the past couple of months.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient states that his symptoms are consistent with a flare-up of multiple sclerosis. He has been taking Tylenol and Motrin as needed for pain, but his symptoms have not improved over the past few days. He wishes to see a neurosurgeon to evaluate for a possible diagnosis of neurovascular disease. I have recommended that he obtain a CT scan of the right side of his face to rule out any signs of a brain tumor. If his CT results do not improve over the next few days, we may need to discuss further treatment options such as surgical intervention or radiation therapy."

[patient] well since the accident yes
[doctor] okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately
[patient] it hurts it hurts
[doctor] absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that
[patient] thinking are are you saying i'm thinking
[doctor] no not by any means i am saying
[patient] pain i have a lot of pain
[doctor] yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible
[patient] said it might be broken
[doctor] what
[patient] pamela said it might be broken
[doctor] if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right
[patient] okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri
[doctor] not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin
[patient] hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl
[doctor] you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this
[patient] i ca n't go to work like this
[doctor] okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay okay any other questions
[patient] not right now
[doctor] alright","

1. Neck pain.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with symptoms consistent with a recent car crash.

- Patient Education and Counseling: I discussed the nature of the diagnosis with the patient. I explained that this is a common issue in car crashes. I encouraged the patient to start writing down the details of his previous car crashes in order to help him understand the severity of his current symptoms. I also advised him to keep a log of his recent car crashes and to contact me if he has any questions or concerns. I advised the patient that I will refer him to physical therapy if his symptoms do not improve over the next couple of weeks. We will also discuss the possibility of obtaining a referral to a pain clinic for further evaluation. I have recommended that the patient follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. I want to make sure that we are providing him with the medication that works like the best for him and that he is comfortable with taking it."
