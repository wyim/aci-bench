[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] to about eight centimeters . on your heart exam , i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past . and , on your lung exam , i do appreciate some fine crackles at the bases bilaterally , and your lower extremities have , you know , 1+ pitting edema . so , what does all that mean ? that means i think you're retaining a little bit of fluid .
[patient] mm-hmm .

[patient] sure .
[doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the chest x-ray . so , looking here at the results of your chest x-ray , it does look like you have a little bit of fluid in your lungs there , and that can be just from , um , your heart failure , okay ? hey , dragon ? show me the echocardiogram . so , this is the echocardiogram that we did about four months ago , and this shows that the pumping function of your heart is a little bit reduced at 45 % , and it also shows that leaky valve , the mitral regurgitation that , that you have , okay ? um , so , let me just go over and talk about , a little bit , my assessment and my plan for you .

virtassist,D2N069,"[doctor] hi , ms. thompson . i'm dr. moore . how are you ?
[patient] hi , dr. moore .
[doctor] hi .
[patient] i'm doing okay except for my knee .
[doctor] all right , hey , dragon , ms. thompson is a 43 year old female here for right knee pain . so tell me what happened with your knee ?
[patient] well , i was , um , trying to change a light bulb , and i was up on a ladder and i kinda had a little bit of a stumble and kinda twisted my knee as i was trying to catch my fall .
[doctor] okay . and did you injure yourself any place else ?
[patient] no , no . it just seems to be the knee .
[doctor] all right . and when did this happen ?
[patient] it was yesterday .
[doctor] all right . and , uh , where does it hurt mostly ?
[patient] it hurts like in , in , in the inside of my knee .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] right here .
[doctor] all right . and anything make it better or worse ?
[patient] i have been putting ice on it , uh , and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it does n't seem to help much .
[doctor] okay . so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago , and you've hurt something inside of your right knee .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ?
[patient] that's right . yeah .
[doctor] okay , let's review your past history for a second . it looks like , uh , do you have any other past medical history ?
[patient] uh , afib .
[doctor] okay , and are you taking any medications for that ?
[patient] yeah , i am . um , begins with a d.
[doctor] uh , digoxin ?
[patient] that's it . yeah , that's it .
[doctor] okay , all right . how about any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] i have had a nose job .
[doctor] all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ?
[patient] right on the inside of my knee . right here .
[doctor] all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ?
[patient] yes , that hurts .
[doctor] all right , how about if i twist it a little bit that way .
[patient] that hurts a lot .
[doctor] okay , okay . and how about down here ? do you feel me touch you down here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . any other pain down here in your calves ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no , okay . so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your , uh , when i , uh , uh , do some valgus stressing on your , on your leg . um , you have normal sensation . so let's take a look at your x-rays .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . so looking at the x-ray , um , of your left knee , uh , it appears to be there's no fractures there right now . i do n't see any , uh , there's a little bit of , uh , fluid , uh , but there is no , uh , there's no , um , fracture or there's no dislocation . everything else seems to be lined up properly , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so in summary after my exam , uh , looking at your knee , uh , on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus , so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain . uh , at this point , my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace , uh , and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days . we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing , and if it's not better , we'll get an mri at that time .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i'm going to recommend we give you some motrin , 800 milligrams . uh , you can take it about every six hours , uh , with food . uh , and we'll give you about a two week supply .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . uh , do you have any questions ?
[patient] no , i think i'm good .
[doctor] all right . hey , dragon , order the medications and procedures discussed , and finalize the report . okay , come with me and we'll get you checked out .","[doctor] hi , ms. thompson . i'm dr. moore . how are you ?

virtassist,D2N070,"[doctor] hi logan . how are you ?
[patient] hey , good to see you .
[doctor] it's good to see you as well .
[doctor] so i know the nurse told you about dax .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] so logan is a 58 year old male , with a past medical history significant for diabetes type 2 , hypertension , osteoarthritis , who presents today with some back pain .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so logan , what happened to your back ?
[patient] uh , we were helping my daughter with some heavy equipment and lifted some boxes a little too quickly , and they were a little too heavy .
[doctor] okay ... and did you strain your back , did something-
[patient] i thought i heard a pop when i moved and i had to lie down for about an hour before it actually relieved the pain . and then it's been a little stiff ever since . and this was- what , so today's tuesday . this was saturday morning .
[doctor] okay , all right .
[doctor] and is it your lower back , your upper back ?
[patient] my lower back .
[doctor] your lower back , okay . and what- what have you taken for the pain ?
[patient] i took some tylenol , i took some ibuprofen , i used a little bit of icy heat on the spot but it really did n't seem to help .
[doctor] okay . and um ... do you have any numbing or tingling in your legs ?
[patient] uh ... i felt some tingling in my toes on my right foot until about sunday afternoon . and then that seemed to go away .
[doctor] okay , and is there a position that you feel better in ?
[patient] uh ... it's really tough to find a comfortable spot sleeping at night . i would- i tend to lie on my right side and that seemed to help a little bit ?
[doctor] okay , all right .
[doctor] well , um ... so how are you doing otherwise ? i know that , you know , we have some issues to talk-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . about today . were you able to take any vacations over the summer ?
[patient] um ... some long weekends , which was great . just kind of- trying to mix it up through the summer . so lots of three day weekends .
[doctor] okay , well i'm glad to hear that .
[doctor] um ... so let's talk a little bit about your diabetes . how are you doing with that ? i know that- you know , i remember you have a sweet tooth . so ...
[patient] yeah ... i-i love peanut butter cups . um ... and i have to say that when we were helping my daughter , we were on the fly and on the go and haven't had a home cooked meal in weeks, our diets were less than stellar .
[patient] and uh ... i-i think i need to go clean for a couple of weeks . but other than that , it was been- it's been pretty good eating .
[doctor] okay , all right . and how about your high blood pressure ? are you monitoring your blood pressure readings at home , like i recommended ?
[patient] i'm good about it during the week while i am at home working, but on the weekends when i'm out of the house i tend to forget . uh , and so it's not as regimented , but it's been pretty good and-and under control for the most part .
[doctor] okay , and you're you're taking your medication ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] okay . and then lastly , i know that you had had some early arthritis in your knee . how- how are you doing with that ?
[patient] uh ... it gets aggravated every once in a while . if i- maybe if i run too much or if i've lift boxes that are a little too heavy , i start to feel the strain . but it's been okay . not great , but it's been okay .
[doctor] okay . all right , well ... let me go ahead and- you know , i know that the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you when you- when you checked in . i know that you were endorsing the back pain .
[doctor] have you had any other symptoms , chest pain , nausea or vomiting-
[patient] no .
[doctor] . fever , chills ?
[patient] no . no none whatsoever .
[doctor] no . okay . all right , well let me go ahead , i want to do a quick physical exam .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure .
[doctor] so it's a little elevated . your blood pressure's a little elevated here in the office , but you know you could be in some pain , which could make your-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . blood pressure go up . let's look at the readings .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure readings .
[doctor] yeah ... yeah you know they do run a little bit on the high side , so we'll have to address that as well .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay , well . let me- i'm just going to be listening your heart and your lungs and i'll check out your back and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] and kick against my hands .
[doctor] okay , good . all right .
[doctor] okay , so ... on physical examination , you know , i-i do hear a slight 2 out of 6 s- s- systolic heart murmur .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] on your heart exam . which you've had in the past .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so that sounds stable to me .
[doctor] on your back exam , you know , you do have some pain to palpation of the lumbar spine . and you have pain with flexion and extension of the back . and you have a negative straight leg raise , which is which is good . so , let's- let's just look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the diabetes labs .
[doctor] okay , so ... in reviewing the results of your diabetes labs , your hemoglobin a1c is a little elevated at eight . i'd like to see it a little bit better , okay ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the back x-ray .
[doctor] so in reviewing the results of your back x-ray , this looks like a normal x-ray . there's good bony alignment , there's normal uh- there's no fracture present . uh , so this is a normal x-ray of your back , which is not surprising based on-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . the history , okay ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so let's just go ahead and we'll- we're going to go over , you know , my assessment and my plan for you .
[doctor] so for your first problem , your back pain . you know , i think you have a lumbar strain from the lifting . so , let's go ahead . we can prescribe you some meloxicam 15 mg once a day .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i want you to continue to ice it , okay . i want you to try to avoid any strenuous activity and we can go ahead and- and refer you to physical therapy-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . and see how you do , okay ?
[patient] you got it .
[doctor] for your next problem , your diabetes . y-you know , i think it's a little under- out of control . so i want to increase the metformin to 1000 mg twice a day . and i'm going to um ... um ... i'm going to repeat a hemoglobin a1c in about 6 months , okay ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] hey dragon ? order a hemoglobin a1c .
[doctor] so , for your third problem , your hypertension . uh ... i-i'd like to go ahead increase the lisinopril from 10 mg to 20 mg a day .
[patient] mm-hmm .

[doctor] i'd like to tell dax a little bit about you .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] so logan is a 58 year old male , with a past medical history significant for diabetes type 2 , hypertension , osteoarthritis , who presents today with some back pain .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so logan , what happened to your back ?
[patient] uh , we were helping my daughter with some heavy equipment and lifted some boxes a little too quickly , and they were a little too heavy .
[doctor] okay ... and did you strain your back , did something-
[patient] i thought i heard a pop when i moved and i had to lie down for about an hour before it actually relieved the pain . and then it's been a little stiff ever since . and this was- what , so today's tuesday . this was saturday morning .
[doctor] okay , all right .
[doctor] and is it your lower back , your upper back ?
[patient] my lower back .
[doctor] your lower back , okay . and what- what have you taken for the pain ?
[patient] i took some tylenol , i took some ibuprofen , i used a little bit of icy heat on the spot but it really did n't seem to help .
[doctor] okay . and um ... do you have any numbing or tingling in your legs ?
[patient] uh ... i felt some tingling in my toes on my right foot until about sunday afternoon . and then that seemed to go away .
[doctor] okay , and is there a position that you feel better in ?
[patient] uh ... it's really tough to find a comfortable spot sleeping at night . i would- i tend to lie on my right side and that seemed to help a little bit ?
[doctor] okay , all right .
[doctor] well , um ... so how are you doing otherwise ? i know that , you know , we have some issues to talk-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . about today . were you able to take any vacations over the summer ?
[patient] um ... some long weekends , which was great . just kind of- trying to mix it up through the summer . so lots of three day weekends .
[doctor] okay , well i'm glad to hear that .
[doctor] um ... so let's talk a little bit about your diabetes . how are you doing with that ? i know that- you know , i remember you have a sweet tooth . so ...
[patient] yeah ... i-i love peanut butter cups . um ... and i have to say that when we were helping my daughter , we were on the fly and on the go and haven't had a home cooked meal in weeks, our diets were less than stellar .
[patient] and uh ... i-i think i need to go clean for a couple of weeks . but other than that , it was been- it's been pretty good eating .
[doctor] okay , all right . and how about your high blood pressure ? are you monitoring your blood pressure readings at home , like i recommended ?
[patient] i'm good about it during the week while i am at home working, but on the weekends when i'm out of the house i tend to forget . uh , and so it's not as regimented , but it's been pretty good and-and under control for the most part .
[doctor] okay , and you're you're taking your medication ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] okay . and then lastly , i know that you had had some early arthritis in your knee . how- how are you doing with that ?
[patient] uh ... it gets aggravated every once in a while . if i- maybe if i run too much or if i've lift boxes that are a little too heavy , i start to feel the strain . but it's been okay . not great , but it's been okay .
[doctor] okay . all right , well ... let me go ahead and- you know , i know that the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you when you- when you checked in . i know that you were endorsing the back pain .
[doctor] have you had any other symptoms , chest pain , nausea or vomiting-
[patient] no .
[doctor] . fever , chills ?
[patient] no . no none whatsoever .
[doctor] no . okay . all right , well let me go ahead , i want to do a quick physical exam .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure .
[doctor] so it's a little elevated . your blood pressure's a little elevated here in the office , but you know you could be in some pain , which could make your-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . blood pressure go up . let's look at the readings .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the blood pressure readings .
[doctor] yeah ... yeah you know they do run a little bit on the high side , so we'll have to address that as well .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay , well . let me- i'm just going to be listening your heart and your lungs and i'll check out your back and i'll let you know what i find , okay ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] and kick against my hands .
[doctor] okay , good . all right .
[doctor] okay , so ... on physical examination , you know , i-i do hear a slight 2 out of 6 s- s- systolic heart murmur .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] on your heart exam . which you've had in the past .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so that sounds stable to me .
[doctor] on your back exam , you know , you do have some pain to palpation of the lumbar spine . and you have pain with flexion and extension of the back . and you have a negative straight leg raise , which is which is good . so , let's- let's just look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the diabetes labs .
[doctor] okay , so ... in reviewing the results of your diabetes labs , your hemoglobin a1c is a little elevated at eight . i'd like to see it a little bit better , okay ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the back x-ray .
[doctor] so in reviewing the results of your back x-ray , this looks like a normal x-ray . there's good bony alignment , there's normal uh- there's no fracture present . uh , so this is a normal x-ray of your back , which is not surprising based on-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . the history , okay ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so let's just go ahead and we'll- we're going to go over , you know , my assessment and my plan for you .
[doctor] so for your first problem , your back pain . you know , i think you have a lumbar strain from the lifting . so , let's go ahead . we can prescribe you some meloxicam 15 mg once a day .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i want you to continue to ice it , okay . i want you to try to avoid any strenuous activity and we can go ahead and- and refer you to physical therapy-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . and see how you do , okay ?
[patient] you got it .
[doctor] for your next problem , your diabetes . y-you know , i think it's a little under- out of control . so i want to increase the metformin to 1000 mg twice a day . and i'm going to um ... um ... i'm going to repeat a hemoglobin a1c in about 6 months , okay ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] hey dragon ? order a hemoglobin a1c .
[doctor] so , for your third problem , your hypertension . uh ... i-i'd like to go ahead increase the lisinopril from 10 mg to 20 mg a day .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] does that sound okay ? i think we need to get it under better control .
[patient] no that's fine . i agree .
[doctor] hey dragon ? order lisinopril 20 mg daily .
[doctor] and for your last problem , your osteoarthritis , i-i think that you were doing a really good job , in terms of you know what , monitoring your knee and uh ...
[patient] mm-hmm .

[patient] mm-hmm .

virtscribe,D2N073,"[doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[doctor] well that's good news .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?
[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?
[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[doctor] okay . anything else ?
[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[patient] okay , that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .","[doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?

virtscribe,D2N074,"[doctor] patient , bruce ward . date of birth 5/21/1969 . please use my neuro consult template . this is a 52-year-old male with dia- newly diagnosed pituitary lesion . the patient is seen in consultation at the request of dr. henry howard for possible surgical intervention . mr . ward presented to his primary care provider , dr. howard , on 3/1/21 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months . he denied any trouble with headaches in the past . his past clinical history is unremarkable .
[doctor] worked out for worsening headaches was initiated with brain mri and serology where pituitary lesion was incidentally discovered . i personally reviewed the labs dated 3/3/21 including cbc , unes , uh , coagulation , and crp . all were normal . pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low tsh , all other results were normal . um , i personally reviewed pertinent radiology studies including mri for the brain with contrast from 3/4/21 . the mri reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm . the ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are lo- are noted .
[doctor] hello , mr . ward . nice to meet you . i'm dr. flores .
[patient] hi , doc . nice to meet you .
[doctor] i was just reviewing your records from dr. howard and he's referred you because the workup for headaches revealed a mass on your pituitary gland . i did review your mri images and you have a significant mass there . can you tell me about the issues you've been experiencing ?
[patient] yeah sure . so i'm really getting fed up with these headaches . i've been trying my best to deal with them but they've been going on for months now and i'm really struggling .
[doctor] where are the headaches located and how would you describe that pain ?
[patient] located behind my eyes . it's like a dull nagging ache .
[doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ?
[patient] well it started about three months ago . and they've been getting worse over time . at first it was like three out of 10 severity , and it just gradually worsened . and now it's about six out of 10 severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and it feels like a dull ache behind the eyes . they last a few hours at a time , nothing makes them better or worse .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me if the pain radiates , or if you have any other symptoms ? specifically feeling sick , fever , rashes , neck stiffness , numbness , weakness , passing out ?
[patient] no . i have n't been sick or felt sick . ca n't recall a fever or any kind of rash . no- no neck issues , no numbness , no tingling . and i've never passed out in my life . but , um , for some reason recently i seem to be bumping into door frames .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any change in your vision or with your balance ?
[patient] no i do n't think so . my eyes were checked in the fall .
[doctor] okay . let's see , do you have any other medical problems that you take medicine for ?
[patient] no i do n't have any medical problems and i do n't take any medicines . i tried tylenol a few times for the headaches but it did n't work , so i stopped .
[doctor] i see . anyone in your family have any history of diseases ?
[patient] i was adopted so i really have no idea .
[doctor] okay . um , what kind of work do you do ? and are you married ?
[patient] i work as a computer programmer and i've been married for 25 years . we just bought a small house .
[doctor] that's nice . um , do you drink any alcohol , smoke , or use recreational drugs ?
[patient] nope . i do n't do any of those and never have .
[doctor] okay . um , well let me take a good look at you . um , now you'll hear me calling out some details as i perform the examination . these will be noted for me in your record and i'll be happy to answer any questions you have once we're done .
[patient] sounds good , doc .
[doctor] all right . the patient is alert , oriented to time , place , and person . affect is appropriate and speech is fluent . cranial nerve examination is grossly intact . no focal , motor , or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities . visual acuity and eye movements are normal . pupils are equal and reactive . visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia . and color vision is normal .
[doctor] all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames .
[patient] yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell .
[doctor] no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery .
[patient] okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ?
[doctor] well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death .
[patient] well i guess we have to do it regardless .
[doctor] okay . so i will have you see our surgery scheduler , deborah , on the way out to get you set up . we will get this scheduled fairly quickly so i do n't want you to be alarmed . um , she'll also get you set up today or tomorrow to have the visual field test and you may not be able to see the eye doctor until after surgery . but we have the pre-surgery visual field test for comparison after surgery .
[patient] okay . i look forward to these headaches going away . i never thought it could be something like this going on .
[doctor] yeah . come this way , we'll get your things lined up . please call if you think of any questions .
[patient] thanks , doctor .

virtscribe,D2N075,"[doctor] next is betty hill , uh , date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . um , i reviewed our records from the er , including the normal cardiac workup , and we're about to go in and see her now . good morning . you miss hill ?
[patient] good morning . yes . that's me .
[doctor] hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you too .
[doctor] so tell me about what brings you in today ?
[patient] well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then .
[doctor] okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ?
[patient] um , early october .
[doctor] of 2020 , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ?
[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .
[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?
[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .
[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?
[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .
[doctor] okay . i see .
[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .
[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?
[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .
[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?
[patient] yes . with eating .
[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?
[patient] mm-hmm . i did .
[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?
[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .
[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .
[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .
[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?
[patient] they're normal .
[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?
[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .
[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?
[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .
[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?
[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .
[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?
[patient] i'd say it's about the same .
[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .
[patient] okay . good .
[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .
[patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .
[doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?
[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .
[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk .
[patient] no . that's it . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks .","[doctor] next is betty hill , uh , date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . um , i reviewed our records from the er , including the normal cardiac workup , and we're about to go in and see her now . good morning . you miss hill ?
[patient] good morning . yes . that's me .
[doctor] hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you too .
[doctor] so tell me about what brings you in today ?
[patient] well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then .
[doctor] okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ?
[patient] um , early october .
[doctor] of 2020 , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ?
[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .
[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?
[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .
[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?
[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .
[doctor] okay . i see .
[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .
[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?
[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .
[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?
[patient] yes . with eating .
[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?
[patient] mm-hmm . i did .
[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?
[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .
[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .
[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .
[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?
[patient] they're normal .
[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?
[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .
[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?
[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .
[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?
[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .
[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?
[patient] i'd say it's about the same .
[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .
[patient] okay . good .
[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .
[patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .
[doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?
[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .
[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk .
[patient] no . that's it . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks ."
virtscribe,D2N076,"[doctor] hello .
[patient_guest] hi .
[doctor] i'm dr. evelyn , one of the kidney doctors . it's good to meet you guys .
[patient_guest] it's nice to meet you also .
[doctor] yeah . so i was reading about this syndrome that i actually have never heard of .
[patient_guest] yeah , me too .
[doctor] i do n't think it's very common .
[patient_guest] definitely not . it's c- pretty rare .
[doctor] so-
[doctor] can you start at the beginning ? i know she's a twin , so are these your first two babies ?
[patient_guest] no , i have a son also who is nine . he also has autism .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and when the twins were born , katherine , she was about 4 pounds , 8 ounces . and her twin was a bit smaller , at 3 pounds , 13 ounces .
[patient_guest] katherine , she was doing fine . she just had problems with eating , where she would stop breathing when she was eating .
[doctor] like preemie type stuff ?
[patient_guest] uh- . yeah . she just had a hard time regulating her temperature , but she did fine . she does have a gi doctor , because she has reflex really bad . she also had a dietician , who told us to take her off cow's milk . which we did . and then she has seen an allergist , and also a neurologist ... who diagnosed her with this syndrome , because she still does n't walk and she was n't sitting by herself a year old .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient_guest] but so now she is crawling and she is trying to take steps , so think she's doing pretty good .
[doctor] good . is she in therapy ?
[patient_guest] she is in therapy . she's in feeding therapy , occupational therapy , and also physical therapy .
[doctor] awesome . okay .
[patient_guest] and we also have speech therapy , who is going to be starting within the next couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient_guest] so , she has a lot of therapies . we have also seen an orthopedic and an ophthalmologist . i can never say that . we have seen everything , really .
[doctor] and audiology too , right ?
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] yeah , wow. .
[patient_guest] yeah , it has definitely been a whirlwind of stuff . when we saw the geneticist , she told us that sometimes people with this syndrome , they have trouble with their kidneys . that they might actually fuse into one . she also said sometimes they have problems with their legs , so that was why we saw ortho .
[doctor] okay . okay .
[patient_guest] so we have seen everybody , really . we are just here to make sure that her kidneys are looking good right now .
[doctor] yeah , okay . so , um , tell me about how many wet diapers she has in a 24 hour period ?
[patient_guest] she has a lot .
[doctor] so like normal 8 to 10 , or like 20 ?
[patient_guest] yeah , it's around 8 to 10 .
[doctor] okay . great .
[patient_guest] yeah , she seems to pee a lot , and it feels like she drinks a lot too .
[doctor] that's perfect .
[patient_guest] and she used to only drink milk , and then i took her off dairy milk . so when i say milk , i actually mean , you know , ripple pea protein milk .
[doctor] sure , yeah .
[patient_guest] so i give her that milk , water now that she's used to it , and sometimes water with just a little bit of juice . so i do feel like she's drinking a lot better now .
[doctor] that's great . and she's how old now ?
[patient_guest] she'll be two mo- two next month .
[doctor] okay . is her twin a boy or a girl ?
[patient_guest] she's a girl .
[doctor] okay , and how's she doing ?
[patient_guest] she's doing really good . she's running around , and she does n't have any problems .
[doctor] all right . is she bigger than her or the same size ?
[patient_guest] they're about the same size . they're able to wear the same clothes , so ...
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] i do n't even think she's a pound hav- heavier , actually .
[doctor] yeah . yeah .
[patient_guest] but she is a little bit taller than her ... um , katherine . she's just sh- a little shorter and chunkier , but i think that's a part of her syndrome .
[doctor] yeah . yeah , i was reading all the things associated with the syndrome . it sounds like we're looking for continual- congenital anomalies wi- of the kidney and urinary tract . which is basically something is wrong with the plumbing .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] so the only way to know that , is to do a kidney ultrasound .
[patient_guest] okay , that sounds okay .
[doctor] okay . let me put that into the system , and then downstairs they can do the ultrasound .
[patient_guest] all right , thank you .
[doctor] okay , yeah . where do you all live ?
[patient_guest] uh , we live in dallas .
[doctor] okay . anybody in the family with kidney failure , dialysis or transplant ?
[patient_guest] no .
[doctor] okay . so let's get your ultrasound done , and we'll see how it goes .
[patient_guest] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] all right . let me take a quick look at her .
[patient_guest] sure .
[doctor] all right . please use my physical exam template . um , i wan na take a quick listen to her heart and lungs . i'll look in her ears too . and she can sit , she can just sit on your lap .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right . that's it .
[patient_guest] all right , that was n't too bad .
[doctor] hmm . so , let's complete the ultrasound today . i'll call you with the results . if it's normal , you wo n't need to see me again , but if it's abnormal , you can see me in kennesaw .
[patient_guest] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . we'll determine what the next steps are if there are any , after we see her results .
[patient_guest] all right , sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . the nurse will be in to have you complete some paperwork , and give you instructions for the ultrasound . we'll talk soon .
[patient_guest] all right . thank you , and have a good day .
[doctor] you too .
[doctor] all right . physical exams show the well-nourished female , who is slightly fussy when examined . eyes are small appearing . she has mild hypotonia of the lower extremities in her arms . normal external female genitalia .
[doctor] assessment and plan . katherine is a 22-month-old former 34 and 3-week-old , twin with smith magenis syndrome . several organ systems can be affected by this chromosomal deletion syndrome . congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract have been reported in the literature .
[doctor] we will obtain the screening of the kidneys by ultrasound today . if there are abnormalities on the kidney ultrasound , we will determine next steps and future follow-up . the family lives in dallas , georgia , so her follow-up should be at the town center location .

aci,D2N077,"[doctor] hey diana it's good to see you in here so i see that you injured your wrist could you tell me a bit about what happened
[patient] yeah i was walking up and down the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen
[doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right
[patient] it's my right one of course
[doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before
[patient] no i have not
[doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain
[patient] gosh it's like a nine
[doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it
[patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right
[doctor] okay
[patient] really
[doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen
[patient] this happened yesterday morning
[doctor] okay
[patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just not it's really bad
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry
[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally
[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just really along my wrist
[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling
[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling
[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] it does
[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well
[patient] yeah it does
[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like
[patient] not without extreme pain
[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up
[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually
[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright and then lateral as well
[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason
[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist
[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight
[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you
[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all
[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down
[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better
[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] pardon what
[patient] a what
[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace
[patient] okay thank you
[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay
[patient] when do i have to have the surgery
[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so what
[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace
[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks
[patient] six weeks
[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of
[patient] oof
[doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions
[patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery
[doctor] yeah
[patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so
[doctor] okay how long is the vacation
[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks
[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks
[patient] no vacation in a month
[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do
[patient] that sounds good thank you
[doctor] no problem bye
[patient] bye
[doctor] the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present","[doctor] hey diana it's good to see you in here so i see that you injured your wrist could you tell me a bit about what happened
[patient] yeah i was walking up and down the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen

[doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain
[patient] gosh it's like a nine
[doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it
[patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right
[doctor] okay
[patient] really
[doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen
[patient] this happened yesterday morning
[doctor] okay
[patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just not it's really bad
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry
[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally
[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's just really along my wrist
[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling
[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling
[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] it does
[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well
[patient] yeah it does
[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like
[patient] not without extreme pain
[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up
[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually
[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright and then lateral as well
[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason
[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist
[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight
[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you
[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all
[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down
[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better
[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] pardon what
[patient] a what
[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace
[patient] okay thank you
[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay
[patient] when do i have to have the surgery
[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so what
[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace
[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks
[patient] six weeks
[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of
[patient] oof
[doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions
[patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery
[doctor] yeah
[patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so
[doctor] okay how long is the vacation
[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks
[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks
[patient] no vacation in a month
[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do
[patient] that sounds good thank you
[doctor] no problem bye
[patient] bye
[doctor] the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present"
aci,D2N078,"[doctor] hey philip good to see you today so take a look here at my notes i see you're coming in for some right knee pain and you have a past medical history of hypertension and we will take a look at that so can you tell me what happened to your knee

[doctor] okay and did it was it swollen afterwards or is it looks a little bit swollen right now
[patient] yeah little bit swollen yeah
[doctor] okay so so far have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] just taking some ibuprofen just for some swelling
[doctor] okay that's it what would you say your pain score is a out of ten with ten being the worst pain you ever felt
[patient] i would say that when i'm stationary i do n't really feel a lot of pain but if i start doing some mobility i would say probably a four five
[doctor] about a four okay and how long ago did you say this was is this happened this injury
[patient] it's been a week now
[doctor] a week okay alright alright so we will take a look i'll do a physical exam of your knee in a second but i do want to check up you do have a past medical history of hypertension i'm seeing here you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly
[patient] yes i have
[doctor] okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that
[patient] i definitely need some help there i have not have not made some some changes
[doctor] okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today

[patient] about i want to say a few weeks i think it's been about three weeks now
[doctor] okay and do you remember what you were doing when the pain started
[patient] honestly i've been trying to recall if i had any specific injury and i ca n't think of that
[doctor] okay
[patient] of anything the only thing i can think of is that i you know i am active and we've just been doing a lot of work in our basement so if i do n't know if i did something while doing that
[doctor] okay alright tell me have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
[patient] you know i i'm really active and so i i will get some aches and pains here and there but nothing that tylenol ca n't take care of
[doctor] okay good but now are you able to move your arm
[patient] you know i have trouble when i'm trying to reach for something or lift any objects and i do n't even try to reach it for anything over my head because then it'll really hurt
[doctor] okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go
[patient] the pain is always there and then it gets worse like if i try to put any pressure on it it gets worse so if i'm laying at night if i try to even lay on that shoulder it's unbearable
[doctor] okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain
[patient] i've been taking two extra strength tylenol every six to eight hours
[doctor] alright and and did that help
[patient] it does take the edge off but i still have some pain
[doctor] okay well i'm sorry to hear that you know you know renovating the basement it can be quite a task and it can take a toll on you

aci,D2N080,"[doctor] okay hi andrea well i
[patient] hello
[doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on
[patient] it it's not the right knee it's the left knee
[doctor] okay the left knee
[patient] and it just happens occasionally less than once a day when i'm walking all of a sudden it is kind of like gives out and i think here i'm going to fall but i usually catch myself so lot of times i have to hold a grocery cart and that helps a lot so it comes and goes and it it passes just about as quickly as it comes i do n't know what it is whether i stepped wrong or i just do n't know
[doctor] okay well so where does it hurt like in on the inside or the outside or
[patient] internally and it it just the whole kneecap fades
[doctor] okay well did you hear or feel a pop at any point
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] like that
[doctor] have you ever had any type of injury to that knee i mean did you fall or bump it against something or
[patient] no not that i can recall
[doctor] okay and have is it painful have you taken anything for for pain
[patient] no because it does n't last that long
[doctor] okay
[patient] it just like i said it just it goes about as fast as i came in
[doctor] so is it interfering with your just things you like to do and
[patient] hmmm no not really
[doctor] so i know you said that you like to do a lot of travel
[patient] yeah i've got a trip planned here in the next month or so and we are going down to columbus georgia to a a lion's club function and probably be doing a lot of walking there and they got some line dances planned and i do n't think i will be able to participate in that because of the knee
[doctor] is that where you would be kicking your leg out or something
[patient] no it's do n't you know what line dancing is like dancing in theories of fairly fast moves but it's mostly sideways motion
[doctor] and is and that you think that's when your knee might give out then or just not gon na take the chance
[patient] not gon na take the chance
[doctor] okay yeah that sounds like a good idea have you thought about even having a a cane just in case or do you think that's does that happen often enough
[patient] wrap it i would n't be able to keep track of it so no no pain
[doctor] okay okay well so since you're in how about your blood pressure how how is it doing and have you been taking your blood pressures at home like we talked about
[patient] yes they are doing fine still about the same
[doctor] so
[patient] correct that whatever
[doctor] so what has it been running
[patient] i ca n't really remember it's been several days since i took it but i think it runs around one twenty over seventy somewhere along in there
[doctor] okay alright and so what about your medication we have you on some medication for your blood pressure right
[patient] yes i take take them regularly at eight thirty in the morning and eight thirty at night
[doctor] and what is the medication and the dosage that you are taking
[patient] i'm taking a farxiga and amlodipine
[doctor] okay
[patient] and lisinopril and the hydrochlorothiazide so i i ca n't pronounce that one so but those are all small dosage pills
[doctor] that but yeah go ahead
[patient] no that was it i just take them regularly eight thirty in the morning eight thirty at night
[doctor] yeah well that's good i i know you said you set an alarm on your phone to make sure that you get them taken at the right time so that's really good and how are your blood sugars doing how is your diet doing
[patient] my blood sugar has been running a little higher at about one thirty
[doctor] is that in the morning when you're fasting
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i have been told that sometimes the morning blood sugars are higher for some reason but i do n't know i i do n't really worry about it as long as it does n't get up too extremely high so
[doctor] and are you taking your metformin
[patient] yes yes that's along with the blood pressure medicine morning and night
[doctor] okay alright so are you are you eating like late at night or anything like that
[patient] no we usually eat by six
[doctor] okay okay alright well hopefully we can get you to feeling better okay so i want to do a quick physical exam really check that knee out so your vital signs look good they they look alright your temperature is ninety eight . two your pulse is seventy two respirations are sixteen blood pressure is one twenty two over seventy so that looks fine i'm gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs so on your heart exam it's a nice regular rate and rhythm but i appreciate a slight two over six systolic ejection murmur at the left base here on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally okay now let's take a quick look at that knee so does it hurt when i press on it
[patient] no
[doctor] okay can you bend your knee and straighten it out
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na do some maneuvers and i'm gon na just gon na call out my findings on this okay on your right knee exam no ecchymosis or edema no effusion no pain to palpation of the of the left medial knee is there any decreased range of motion do you feel you feel like you're you're able to fully move that as you should the same as the other knee
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay so no decreased range of motion negative varus and valgus test okay and so with your x-rays i reviewed the result of your left knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so lem me tell you a little bit about my plan so your left knee pain i think you just have some arthritis in that i want to prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams a day we might do some physical therapy for that just to strengthen the muscles around that area and prevent any further problems with that okay and so for your second problem the hypertension so i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams a day and order an echocardiogram just to evaluate that heart murmur alright and
[patient] okay
[doctor] for the diabetes mellitus i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin and i'm also gon na order a lipid panel okay do you have any questions
[patient] no i do n't think so when will all this take place
[doctor] we will get you scheduled for the echocardiogram i will have my nurse come in and we will get that set up okay","[doctor] okay hi andrea well i
[patient] hello
[doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on
[patient] it it's not the right knee it's the left knee
[doctor] okay the left knee
[patient] and it just happens occasionally less than once a day when i'm walking all of a sudden it is kind of like gives out and i think here i'm going to fall but i usually catch myself so lot of times i have to hold a grocery cart and that helps a lot so it comes and goes and it it passes just about as quickly as it comes i do n't know what it is whether i stepped wrong or i just do n't know
[doctor] okay well so where does it hurt like in on the inside or the outside or
[patient] internally and it it just the whole kneecap fades
[doctor] okay well did you hear or feel a pop at any point
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] like that
[doctor] have you ever had any type of injury to that knee i mean did you fall or bump it against something or
[patient] no not that i can recall
[doctor] okay and have is it painful have you taken anything for for pain
[patient] no because it does n't last that long
[doctor] okay
[patient] it just like i said it just it goes about as fast as i came in
[doctor] so is it interfering with your just things you like to do and
[patient] hmmm no not really
[doctor] so i know you said that you like to do a lot of travel
[patient] yeah i've got a trip planned here in the next month or so and we are going down to columbus georgia to a a lion's club function and probably be doing a lot of walking there and they got some line dances planned and i do n't think i will be able to participate in that because of the knee
[doctor] is that where you would be kicking your leg out or something
[patient] no it's do n't you know what line dancing is like dancing in theories of fairly fast moves but it's mostly sideways motion
[doctor] and is and that you think that's when your knee might give out then or just not gon na take the chance
[patient] not gon na take the chance
[doctor] okay yeah that sounds like a good idea have you thought about even having a a cane just in case or do you think that's does that happen often enough
[patient] wrap it i would n't be able to keep track of it so no no pain
[doctor] okay okay well so since you're in how about your blood pressure how how is it doing and have you been taking your blood pressures at home like we talked about
[patient] yes they are doing fine still about the same
[doctor] so
[patient] correct that whatever
[doctor] so what has it been running
[patient] i ca n't really remember it's been several days since i took it but i think it runs around one twenty over seventy somewhere along in there
[doctor] okay alright and so what about your medication we have you on some medication for your blood pressure right
[patient] yes i take take them regularly at eight thirty in the morning and eight thirty at night
[doctor] and what is the medication and the dosage that you are taking
[patient] i'm taking a farxiga and amlodipine
[doctor] okay
[patient] and lisinopril and the hydrochlorothiazide so i i ca n't pronounce that one so but those are all small dosage pills
[doctor] that but yeah go ahead
[patient] no that was it i just take them regularly eight thirty in the morning eight thirty at night
[doctor] yeah well that's good i i know you said you set an alarm on your phone to make sure that you get them taken at the right time so that's really good and how are your blood sugars doing how is your diet doing

[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me
[patient] yeah that's a mouthful
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here

[doctor] yeah i just saw that
[patient] if you can do that
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just
[doctor] okay
[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up
[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me
[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections
[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual
[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections
[doctor] diarrhea no
[patient] frequently
[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of
[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies

[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes

[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes
[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that
[doctor] i know i know
[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away
[doctor] right
[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products
[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally
[patient] okay where did you go
[doctor] i was in zambia
[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful
[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time
[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial
[doctor] no
[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you
[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried
[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea

[patient] no nothing i i really was trying to think if there is anything else and i ca n't think of anything
[doctor] okay and you've never injured that right elbow before
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life
[patient] i would say probably a six
[doctor] okay and does that pain keep you up at night
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities
[patient] yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm but yeah it's it's it's difficult for me sometimes to lift and do things because of that pain
[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on
[patient] about four days now
[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief
[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much
[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here
[patient] yes i do
[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain to palpation you do note that moderate tenderness of the medial epicondyle now i'm gon na have you turn your wrist as if you're turning a door knob do you have any pain when you do that

aci,D2N085,"[doctor] hi russell how are you what's been going on
[patient] well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days
[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee
[patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit
[doctor] okay do you notice any blood i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes okay and what have you taken for the pain i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones yes my father had them and have you had kidney stones before yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you","[doctor] hi russell how are you what's been going on

aci,D2N086,"[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that
[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics
[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left
[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now
[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point
[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that
[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc
[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park
[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now
[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there
[patient] i do n't feel that right there
[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure
[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture
[doctor] correct
[patient] if i heard
[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] alright","[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that
[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics
[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left
[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now
[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point
[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that
[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc
[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park
[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now
[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there
[patient] i do n't feel that right there
[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure
[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture
[doctor] correct
[patient] if i heard
[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy
[patient] okay sounds good
