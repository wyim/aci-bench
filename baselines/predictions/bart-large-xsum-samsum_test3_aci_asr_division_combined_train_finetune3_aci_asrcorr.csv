CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left-sided back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sean Williams is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left-sided low back pain following a microdiscectomy. He underwent back surgery in November of 2018. He reports that he was highly dosed up on gabapentin at the time of his surgery and describes his pain as difficult to withdraw from the medication. He continues to experience lower extremity pain randomly. He states that his significant other always tells him to stretch and it usually works. He denies any pain with weightbearing or extension. The patient denies right-sided pain with flexion or extension while he is just standing or bending over. The only area of pain he reports is along the left side of his back that he notices is right around his spinal cord and lower back pain is localized to the l5 and 6th cervical vertebrae. There is no pain with bending forward or with extension, however, he states that it would normally hurt when he is standing or leaning forward. He notes that he has a lot of bending over which may be the cause of his pain. He endorses
PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Normal range of motion. No pain with dorsiflexion. Pain with palpation to the left side around the l5. Pain without extension.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
- Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Trace lower back pain to palpation bilaterally, but no pain with flexion to the right side. Pain where palpation is greatest, but not along the L5.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray images of the bilateral lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony dislocation. There is a mild-to-moderate separation of the L5 and L6 vertebrae. There appears to be a muscle pull there from having a misalignment in your spine.


Previous treatment for this condition was gabapentin, which was highly-prescribed and effective at the time of the surgery in November of 2002.
4

Previous spinal fusion surgery was performed in January of 2003.


ASSESSMENT

Left lower back pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. We discussed treatment options for this pain and I have recommended that we start him on meloxicam 500 mg twice a day. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve with this regimen, I will recommend a change to ibuprofen 800 mg daily."
aci,ACI083,"[doctor] well good morning emily how are you

[doctor] oh
[patient] maybe a different one i wonder if patient has history of
[doctor] macular degeneration yeah yeah i was because we do n't we do n't to do the intro anymore i was just going with that you you're coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring of vision so i'll just you know i'll just say i'll just go ahead and go into this technician part so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right
[patient] it is yes
[doctor] okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks
[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused
[doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you
[patient] yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights
[doctor] uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to
[patient] i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington
[doctor] that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there
[patient] they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that
[doctor] that sounds really nice very good
[patient] it's just
[doctor] yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
[patient] yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop
[doctor] okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication
[patient] i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so
[doctor] okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes or pe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three or pe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions
[patient] i do not no that sounds great
[doctor] okay","

[doctor] no okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks
[patient] yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it
[doctor] all the way back
[patient] okay let's see
[doctor] okay
[patient] good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too
[doctor] yeah that's fine
[patient] okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax
[doctor] mm-hmm valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee
[patient] mm-hmm yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me
[doctor] okay
[patient] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts
[doctor] yeah sometimes
[patient] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like
[doctor] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts
[patient] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] you actually no
[doctor] yeah it hurts no
[patient] what about you i mean are you real weak
[doctor] no i would say i'm pretty strong
[patient] did you go to the gym
[doctor] i go to the gym but i swim so the
[patient] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay
[doctor] yes sir work harder okay
[patient] do you do you play sports in in college or high school
[doctor] i did in high school
[patient] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids
[doctor] no
[patient] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog
[doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim
[patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee
[doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that
[patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's pretty bad
[doctor] okay
[patient] we'll get we'll get to that too
[doctor] okay
[patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today
[doctor] yes
[patient] okay do i go into that to
[doctor] yeah
[patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it
[patient] you're only cup of this
[doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up
[patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament
[doctor] okay
[patient] does that make sense
[doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here
[patient] okay
[doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first
[patient] okay
[doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary
[patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work
[patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this
[doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy
[patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right
[doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good
[patient] did you get did you select you last night
[doctor] i did
[patient] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for
[doctor] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful
[patient] are you serious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] rockets
[doctor] i live in dallas yes
[patient] yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls
[doctor] no no
[patient] my gosh alright we're gon na have to work on you
[doctor] okay thanks
[patient] okay
[doctor] bye
[patient] you got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight we'll talk about this later okay
[doctor] yes sir
[patient] alright very good any questions at all
[doctor] no
[patient] okay so","
CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Howard Howard is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, when he fell off of his tandem bike while riding with his partner and hit his knee on the curb. He states that they saw a squirrel. He denies any pain at the time of the injury. He explains that he washed it out and put a band-aid on it, but it has been worse everyday since then. He tried taking ibuprofen, which was fine at first, but he notes that it is not recommended for more than 2 weeks and reads on the label that you are not supposed to take it longer than that. He notes that his knee still hurts when he touches it. The patient works in a children's hospital and enjoys playing around in the nicu's where he is a baby rocker professionally. She also enjoys taking walks with her dog. She denies any romantic involvement outside of work.


MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of knee pain, but denies any specific injury
PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: Full posterior drawer. Negative valgus drawer. Tenderness over the medial joint line. Nontender skin over the lateral side. Popliteal space is nontender over this side. She has about a dime size little abrasions dry. She works in a children's hospital. She is a baby rocker. She goes into nicu's and rocks babies. She also takes walks with her dog. She broke up with her boyfriend. She doesn't know why she fell off the tandem bike. She's not supposed to take painkillers for more than 2 weeks.
objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray images of the right knee taken in office today reveal no evidence of any fractures or osteoarthritis. There is good bony alignment with good cartilage and the anterior aspect of the Lisfranc joint is in good position. There are no obvious bony bony fragments. There appears to be a positive bony tibral attachment. There's a bony fragment in the medial joint space, which is unusual for this type of injury. There seems to be some bony dislocation present. The lateral side of the knee is well-maintained.


ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. We discussed treatment options for her right knee, including continued use of ibuprofen. We also discussed the possibility of performing a stress test on the knee to determine if there is a fibrous tissue present. The patient was advised that this procedure will cause pain and discomfort. I advised her to brace herself while walking the dog. She will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on her progress."

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right elbow pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. We discussed treatment options for his pain including continued use of Motrin as needed and possible surgical intervention. We also discussed the possibility of performing an arterial ultrasound of the left elbow to check for signs of arterial vein thrombosis. The patient is currently on Norvasc 2.5 mg daily, but his blood pressure was one hundred and fifty today, which is slightly elevated. I advised him to continue taking that and continue his metformin 500 mg daily. He will also be referred to a nutritionist to check on his diet and exercise.
2. Hypertension

The patient's blood glucose level was 7.2 in the last 12 months. His last time he checked his a1c was a 7.1. We will order a glucose test today and he will keep track of his blood glucose levels.
3. Diabetes

This is a common issue for patients with high blood glucose"

[doctor] okay
[patient] so
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's it's been it they've been pretty rare
[doctor] okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hobbit cough.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that she is a nurse. She is employed and enjoys her job. She has a family that is doing well, other than her sister being sick, everyone is doing great.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fever, chills, or changes in appetite.
HENT: Reports cough, sore throat, and nasal congestion. Denies dyspnea on exertion.
Neurological: Reports seasonal allergies and runny nose in the springtime, and no body aches.


PHYSICAL EXAM


Neck
- General Examination: No jugular vein distension. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
- Examination of Mouth: Tender to palpation to the right upper lip. No sinuses. No pain.


Diabetes
- Checking Blood Sugar Slight Elevation: It's been okay around seventies in the low range. No dropped systolic ejection murmur.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray of the bilateral sinus cavity is reviewed and revealed a mild sinus infection.
4
Hemoglobin A1c is reviewed at 7.3, which is within normal limits and demonstrates good bony alignment.
5.
Echocardiogram reveals a mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.
6.
Lipid panel demonstrates good sinus development.
7.0 mm HgbA1c, supported by a sinus rhythm is elevated.
10.0, is in good position.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coughing cough.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has had a hacking cough for 3 days now. She was around her sister who is also sick with similar symptoms and she has since developed a cough. The symptoms she shares with her sister are similar to those of a norovirus.

2. Syringes, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, congestion, nasal freshener, nasal discharge, fever, cough, and sore throat are also consistent with Norvasc nasal spray that she has been taking for the past 3 days. Her blood pressure was also elevated at 131/70 mm Hg on the upper end of the normal range. Her hemoglobin A1c was elevated to 140/80 on the new lower dose of metformin, which is a new medication for her. She has been compliant with the hydrochlorothiazide she was prescribed for her cough, but has been inconsistent with taking it every day. The patient was on vacation last week and her blood glucose levels were higher than usual due to the high number of people in her socializing group, so her blood pressure may have been affected by that.
3. Diabetes type 2."
aci,ACI068,"[doctor] hey betty how're you
[patient] i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having for a few weeks now
[doctor] wow well i'm sorry to hear that do you remember what you were doing when the pain started
[patient] i you know i ca n't think about anything specifically but i am very active and i also have been renovating my basement so i have been doing a lot with that
[doctor] wow okay and do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything
[patient] no no trauma that i can think of at all
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do n't remember hitting it either
[doctor] okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
[patient] you know i'm active and will have aches and pains here and there but nothing that some tylenol ca n't take care of
[doctor] okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder
[patient] it is
[doctor] okay are you able to move that left arm for me
[patient] you know anytime i try reaching for something or lifting anything i have a lot of pain and i do n't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it it really hurts
[doctor] okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go
[patient] it's all the time and if there is any pressure like when i try to sleep at night i ca n't even lay i'm a side sleeper and it i really gives me a hard time because i'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there
[doctor] okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all
[patient] i ca n't
[doctor] alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side
[patient] i mean it's always there but when i sleep directly on it the pain goes up
[doctor] okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol and i'll take two extra strengths tylenol every six to eight hours
[doctor] okay
[patient] and it does help take the edge off
[doctor] okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level
[patient] without any tylenol i would say my pain is like a three
[doctor] okay and then with tylenol with that
[patient] i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three
[doctor] okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift
[patient] yeah it just time we've been living in this house for some time now and you know with the pandemic we've been home and so decided to do some work
[doctor] nice have you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here
[patient] no
[doctor] yeah it's nice my wife and i were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago so everything's fully stocked and if you guys are doing some renovations you might run down there and you know save big money at home depot
[patient] i definitely will check that out
[doctor] so are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so if you do n't mind i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam i've reviewed your vitals everything looks good there and i'm gon na do a focused exam of your left shoulder now you have limited active and passive range of motion there is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints and you have good hand grip bilaterally neurovascular exam of your left arm your cap refill is brisk in less than three seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality so let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy this means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attach to the shoulder muscles i'm gon na go ahead and order an mri of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder i'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay now during that time i want you to continue to take tylenol p.r.n . if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan
[patient] yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away
[doctor] i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do
[patient] okay alright
[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and i'll see you in about two about two weeks

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Taylor is a pleasant 60-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain, which has been occurring for the past few weeks. The onset of her pain began 3 weeks ago, without any specific injury. There is no specific injury associated with her pain that she can recall of the past 3 weeks. She is very active and has been renovating her basement. She denies any specific trauma. The patient denies any numbness or tingling in her left arm or hand. The pain is constant and is localized to her left shoulder. She states that she tries to reach for something, lift anything, and she cannot raise her arm over her head without pain. She experiences the pain most of the time and it is constant even when she is laying on her left side. She reports that the pain is always there. She has been taking Tylenol, which she rates as 3 out of 10, every 6 to 8 hours, and it does help take the edge off. She also reports that she has pain when she attempts to sleep on her side as she is a side sleeper.
PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Alert and oriented x3. Speech is clear and fluent. Gait is steady. Heel toe walking is normal. Cranial nerves grossly intact without capillary refill. No pronator drift. No clubbing. Sensation is intact in the left shoulder. Tenderness to palpation of the capillar and radial nerves bilaterally. Pain with dorsiflexion, but not with flexion or extension.

MSK: Examination of the right shoulder: 3/5 systolic ejection murmur that is heard at the biceps, triceps, and deltoid joints. Normal ROM. No tendons, but there is some tenderness in the lateral aspect of the shoulder. Good reflexes. Decreased sensation to light touch over the right biceps.


RESULTS

X-ray of the left shoulder was obtained and reviewed today reveals no evidence of any fracture or bony dislocation. There is mild-to-moderate flexion of the lumbar spine with good bony alignment and development of bony tibral osteoarthritis in the anterior aspect of the Lisfranc joint base. There are no signs of any fractures or arthritis in the base of the bony base.

These bony attachments are normal and well-maintained, unlike those of previous shoulder dislocations, which are rare and are easily controlled with corticosteroid medication.


ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a left shoulder tendinopathy. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative use of Tylenol 500 mg every 6 to 8 hours. We also discussed the possibility of obtaining a MRI of the left shoulder to further assess the cause of this pain. The patient was provided with a referral to a radiology lab for this procedure."

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain and hypertension. The onset of his pain began when he was playing basketball yesterday and came down for a rebound. He states that he felt his knee pop and that he could hardly walk when it happened. He describes his pain level as 4 out of 10. He adds that his pain is localized to the inside of his knee and that it feels like it is stabbing. His symptoms are achy and he reports that his left leg is very unstable. He notes that he can bear weight on his right leg but is favoring it. He has tried Tylenol, which did not provide him with relief. He was unable to watch the game last night because his team did not win. He is dissatisfied with his current medication status. He reports that he has been taking metformin 500 mg daily and Norvasc 5 mg daily. He continues to use both of these medications.


PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
- Examination of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds. The left side of the heart is a little bit elevated. The right side is normal. The patient is taking 5 milligrams of norvasc daily. Pain level is 4 out of 10 on the pain scale.


RESULTS

A1c: 7.2


X-ray of the right knee was reviewed today and revealed no evidence of any fracture or osteoarthritis.

4 views of the anterior cruciate ligament were taken. These are normal for the area of the knee and do not appear to be any evidence of a fracture. These reveal well-maintained cartilage with good cartilage and are in good position. There is development of mild arthritis which is normal for a bony alignment and development of the lateral aspect of the lisfranc joint.


4 views are present.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right knee pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and notes today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. We discussed treatment options for his pain and I have recommended that we treat him conservatively with continued use of Tylenol 500 mg twice daily. We also discussed the possibility of changing his medications to try to get his hypertension and diabetes medications as well as his diet. He is compliant with Norvasc 5 mg daily, but his blood pressure readings are usually around 80-90 mm Hg. His hemoglobin A1c was 7.2 today, which is slightly elevated. I advised him to continue taking metformin 5 mg once daily.
2. Hypertension and diabetes

The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated today.
- Medical Reasoning: This is likely related to his basketball game yesterday. He did not watch the game due to pain and was unhappy with his team's performance. His blood glucose level is usually in the 1.5-2.0 range, but today it was 3.5."
aci,ACI061,"[doctor] mister thompson is a 67 -year-old male with a history of essential hypertension hyperlipidemia and osteoarthritis who is here today with elevated and fluctuating blood pressures so hi there mister thompson it's nice to see you again listen i understand you're having some trouble with your blood pressure control i would like to discuss that with you but first i want to ask you i'd like to use this app this new fancy app that's gon na help me focus on you a bit more in our conversation would that be okay with you

[doctor] okay okay and okay and yeah that does sound unusual for you and so it's been high but you've also felt lightheaded at times have you checked your blood pressure when you were feeling lightheaded was it was it low at those times or have you done that
[patient] i've done it both when i felt fine and then when i had the lightheaded episodes actually it's been on the high side

[doctor] yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right
[patient] correct
[doctor] okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound
[patient] i do n't think so anything that i need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things
[doctor] yeah you know be sure you're staying well hydrated you know six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you you know when when it warms up you're certainly gon na prespire more and lose lose more fluid so so i would i would recommend that you continue to have you know a a standard six to eight glasses of of fluid intake per day but yeah that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated you might wan na increase that if you have an increased activity level so alright any other questions for me
[patient] how much beer should i drink
[doctor] probably not the best thing with you know with with with your high blood pressure fluctuating the way it is so not more than a couple drinks a week hate to tell you
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright okay great seeing you we'll see you back see you in a couple of weeks you take care","

[patient] yeah lately i've just been having quite a bit of a headache and i mean every now and then i'll get it but lately it's just been getting worse and i've noticed that my blood pressure has been running high i've been taking it maybe like once a week but the past three weeks it's been really high than usual so i was a little worried
[doctor] do you remember the numbers that you're getting on your blood pressure readings
[patient] yeah so one of them was like one sixty over eighty seven and then the last one was like one seventy five over ninety two
[doctor] okay so it's really high i was looking back and it looks like your blood pressure was pretty normal last time we saw you is one twenty four over eighty two have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine the lisinopril that you've been prescribed
[patient] i have but sometimes i forget i'm i'm embarrassed to tell you that but yeah sometimes i forget i get busy like especially on the weekends i'm very good during the week but on the weekends i tend to forget it and that's when i'm most busy too
[doctor] yeah well i'm also curious you know you have diabetes have you been checking your blood sugar
[patient] yeah i have because i thought maybe you know that's why i'm getting the headaches maybe my sugar was too low or maybe too high but my sugar has been okay it's been running like one twenty sometimes it does get down to like one hundred
[doctor] okay and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that
[patient] not really so much it's it's been pretty much the same but pretty normal
[doctor] okay and when you get these headaches what are you taking for them
[patient] well i take my tylenol hoping it'll just you know go away and then it does some just for a little bit but then it it just goes throughout the day and i start to get them again
[doctor] okay and when you first had the headaches what would you rate the headache at zero no pain ten the worst pain ever
[patient] i would say when i first get them it's about i would say a seven out of ten
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then after you take the tylenol what does it go down to
[patient] it goes down to probably about a four maybe five it i still feel it i still feel annoying but it's not as pounding as as it normally would be
[doctor] okay
[patient] if i did n't take the tylenol
[doctor] yeah and have you ever had headaches like this before
[patient] not like this you know you know as you know sometimes i get migraine but i know i never really take anything for it that's like once a year or once or every two years but not like not like this one headaches like this one
[doctor] okay and have you had any congestion anything like that cough runny nose
[patient] yeah i thought maybe because you know now it's springtime and i tend to get my allergies but it it's it's very different and i've not actually had any like runny nose or cough or congestion along with the headache
[doctor] okay if you tap on your forehead do you have any tenderness
[patient] right here
[doctor] yeah
[patient] just a little not really too much
[doctor] okay if you tap down here on these bones your cheek bones any tenderness there
[patient] a little bit not as much as i guess if i tap up here
[doctor] okay and then if you kinda push on your neck around here any tenderness
[patient] it it's a little tender but it's not it is a little bit i'd say
[doctor] okay okay so you do n't have any frontal sinus tenderness no maxillary sinus tenderness it sounds like you do n't have any lymphadenopathy that would just be if your lymph nodes were tender so yeah you know let's just talk about a few things that i wan na do and then i want you to actually come in and and be seen by doctor ruth so first off your headache i think taking tylenol is great you can keep taking that you know your lisinopril you're on twenty milligrams once a day which is a medium dose but i think we can increase that so for your hypertension and your headaches i'm gon na have you increase your lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then i want you to keep checking your blood pressure and i wan na order some blood tests i'd like to get some just normal blood work we'll get a hemoglobin a1c some laboratory tests things like that and and then for your diabetes i'm gon na have some diabetic education for you that i want you to be able to review it sounds like your blood sugar has been running a little bit high and after you get the blood tests after that's all done i want you to come in to see me or doctor ruth and we'll just make sure that everything is okay that we get your blood pressure under control any questions for me

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Headache.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of hypertension, diabetes, and a 2-year-old grandchild of a female who presents today with a history of headaches and lymphadenia. She denies any allergies or runny nose, but notes that she tends to get her allergies and seasonal allergies in the springtime so she is wondering if there might be an increase in these along with her headaches. The patient rates her headaches as 7 out of 10 with the worst pain 10 when she first gets them. She takes Tylenol for the initial onset of her headaches, which usually lasts for a short period of time and then she starts to get them again. She also reports that her blood pressure has been very high for the past 3 weeks. She states that she has been taking her BP once or twice a week, but she was a little worried because her last BP reading was 1.68 mmHg over 80/2. The past 2 BP readings were also significantly higher than usual: 1.60 over 75, and 1.75 over 75. She notes that her BP was normal the previous time we saw her it was one twenty-four over 80.

[patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep

[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and right after that i have to go to work
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i
[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Recurrent strep.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with symptoms similar to strep throat. He has had 4 sore throats in the last 5 months. His CMP ordered a Ct.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his strep symptoms are consistent with recurrent strep disease. We discussed that strep is caused by adenocarcinoma of the cervical mucosa, which can be caused by inflammation in the lining of the lymphatic system, such as the cervical cysts. We also discussed that this can also occur in children with asthma, allergies, or who smoke. I advised the patient that asthma is a risk factor for strep and encouraged him to continue to limit his exposure to tobacco. I also advised him to watch out for his brother who is a smoker. He should follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his asthma inhalation habits.

[doctor] okay so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated ecchymosis to the right medial knee there is no evidence of an effusion okay so billy what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your in your lungs which we will talk about okay and then and as far as your knee exam it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues okay so for your first problem of your cough you know i do believe that you just have a a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis i really just wan na go ahead and just you know recommend some supportive care you can continue to take over the counter medications we can prescribe guaifenesin six hundred six hundred milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Coughing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

William Henry is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right-sided cough.

He does experience drainage down his throat and sinus pressure in his sinuses. He has a history of hypertension and has been taking lisinopril 20 mg daily. He notes that he has twisted his right knee when he was coughing and fell down the stairs today. He estimates that he probably fell 4 or 5 stairs and injured his knee. He is able to walk normally, but with pain mostly on the inside. He states that he can bend his knee to straighten the knee.


PHYSICAL EXAM


Neck
- General Examination: No jugular vein distension. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Mild clear bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
- Examination of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds. No pain to palpation of the right upper quadrant. No rebound or guarding of the bilateral lower extremities. No enlarged lymph nodes.


Cardiovascular
- Management of Heart/Lymphatic/Musculoskeletal
- Palpation: 1+pitting edema in the right lower quadrant, mostly on the right side.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

Previous hemoglobin A1c is reviewed at 7.3.
These are normal for a first trimester mild-to-moderate diabetes.
Abdominal x-ray images of the right knee were obtained and review in office today reveal no evidence of any fracture or arthritis.


These reveal no signs of acute coronary artery disease, which is unusual for this stage of the disease, but are present in the event of a mild or moderate-onset hypertension.
Impression: mild to severe compartment syndrome.
Electrocardiogram is normal.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coughing.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's cough has worsened in the last 2 days.- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the nature of the diagnosis and treatment options today. I explained that his symptoms are consistent with a congested nasal cavity, drainage down his throat, sinus pain, and a little bit of pressure in his sinuses. We also discussed that he has a history of hypertension and has been on Lisinopril 20 mg twice a day for over a year. He is also a teacher and works as a physical education teacher. We discussed that his right knee x-ray revealed a fracture. He will follow up with me in a minute to assess the extent of his fracture.

2. Hypertension

The patient states that his blood pressure is normal and he has been compliant with his medication. We reviewed the history of his hypertension and that he should continue to monitor his blood pressures daily. I advised him to continue taking Lisinofibrinol 20 mg once a day. He should also continue to watch his salt intake and avoid foods high in sugar.
3. Right knee X-ray

Mr. Bill Young twisted his right"

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Headache.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of history of hypertension, diabetes, and metformin. She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, or dyspnea on a regular basis.


MEDICATIONS

The patient reports taking Metformin every other day, chlorthalidone every other week, and Norvasc every other month. She occasionally forgets to take her other medication, but for the most part she takes it daily. She has a history of occasional missed doses of both of her medications.


PHYSICAL EXAM


Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Stable 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, no murmurs, gallops or rubs

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Mild headache. Tenderness to palpation of the paraspinal area. No clubbing, but there is some cervical tenderness.
- Palpation: Mild rhonchi tenderness on the right side of the head. No erythema or edema.


RESULTS

Echocardiogram reveals a preserved ejection fraction of 55%, abnormal diastolic filling, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.

Hemoglobin A1c is elevated at 7.3, which is elevated for the first time in over a year.
Electrocardiogram reveals no evidence of any fracture or osteoarthritis.
Rapid strep test demonstrates no changes in the anterior cruciate ligament alignment.
Impression: White blood cell count is within normal limits, despite the loss of lumbar Vasa4ward progression.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Headache.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with elevated blood pressure. Her blood pressure this morning was 1.78 mm Hg, which is higher than the 1.00-1.30 range recommended for this time of year. Her hemoglobin A1c was also elevated today, but this is due to an increase in fluid retention rather than a change in her diet. She is currently on metformin, which she is supposed to be taking daily. We will take a look at that as well, as well as her diabetes, to see what we can do with that.

Patient Agreements: Thepatient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

[patient] yeah sometimes i try to stand up and and and like i i ca n't go get weak or if i'm standing up for too long
[doctor] okay so would you would you say that there are certain positions that make you feel better or worse

[patient] no it's not consistent i think i stood up for too long i think i was drinking too
[doctor] okay okay you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past like what were they
[patient] so i i had a doc gave me some injections before i'm not sure what they were though
[doctor] okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective
[patient] no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it
[doctor] okay but did the did the exercises help
[patient] i mean i guess a little
[doctor] okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications
[patient] yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was
[doctor] okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now
[patient] i mean i sit at home all day
[doctor] okay
[patient] watch tv
[doctor] okay
[patient] so not very active i've gained about eighty pounds the past year
[doctor] okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions
[patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis
[doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad
[patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though
[doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking
[patient] what type of smoking
[doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but
[patient] okay
[doctor] have you smoked
[patient] next maybe that i have n't
[doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before
[patient] okay i smoked
[doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it
[patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked
[doctor] okay you have
[patient] too many questions are you the fit
[doctor] i'm your doctor i have to
[patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question
[doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things
[patient] sent them off yeah
[doctor] pardon
[patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen
[doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt
[patient] yeah it hurts
[doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt
[patient] a little bit
[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up
[patient] stop
[doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the
[patient] what does that mean like am i dying
[doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay
[patient] that's a big word
[doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something
[patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that
[doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] can i get pain pills too
[doctor] can you
[patient] for pain
[doctor] can you get what now
[patient] pain pills
[doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have
[patient] i'd say it was n't effective
[doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective
[patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked
[doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery
[patient] i do n't want i know
[doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] do you have any questions
[patient] no
[doctor] alright
[patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection
[doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions
[patient] no
[doctor] okay thank you","

Right shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sharon Taylor is a pleasant 60-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right shoulder pain, right-hand-dominant dysfunction. The onset of her pain began approximately 3 weeks ago, when she was painting her house. She states that she was up on a ladder painting and fell and injured her right shoulder. She was able to get up and continue painting after she iced her arm and took some ice and Advil. She denies any numbness or tingling in her right arm or hand at the time of the injury. The patient denies any previous history of trauma to the right shoulder, however, she has a history of bilateral hand numbness and bilaterally bilateral hand grips. She rates her pain level as about a 6 out of 10 without medication, but with medication it goes down to about a 4. She reports that she is able to move but with some pain lifting overhead and raising her arm overhead.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Denies right shoulder injury.


PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular joint. Good strong bilateral hand grips. Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds bilaterally.
NEURO: Normal strength and sensation. No pain to palpation. No tingling. Right shoulder is able to lift and raise the right arm without pain. Pain level is 4 out of 6.

- Orientation: Gait is steady. Palpated with an antalgic gait.


RESULTS

X-ray of the right shoulder was obtained in office today reveals no fracture or bony abnormality.

Previous x-ray images reveal no evidence of fracture.


Previous bony alignment is normal.


Previous triceps alignment is within normal limits.
Right shoulder was dislocated at the base of the 6th metatarsal with a mild to severe arthritis present. There is development of mild arthritis present, probably due to the presence of a bony fragment in the anterior aspect of the Lisfranc joint, which is reviewed in the previous review.

4 views of the radial joint are reviewed.


ASSESSMENT

Right shoulder pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of Tylenol 600 mg twice a day. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on her progress. If she continues to have pain, we may consider performing a MRI of the right shoulder."
aci,ACI063,"[doctor] good afternoon matthew how are you
[patient] i'm okay
[doctor] it looks like here that the that you've been brought in for some vision changes and looks like you're having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today
[patient] yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment
[doctor] okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on
[patient] well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me
[doctor] okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street
[patient] my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was
[doctor] it was
[patient] it was just phenomenal
[doctor] it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon
[patient] yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for
[doctor] i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day
[patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped
[doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis
[patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it
[doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me
[patient] okay that's a bright light
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection
[patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] well
[patient] what i mean not not yeah literally stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] yeah literally yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection
[patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good
[doctor] okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes
[patient] okay thank you very much
[doctor] thank you","

He noticed that he and his wife eat out almost every night, especially when they go to fancy restaurants. They also noticed that they have trouble adjusting in the dark environment. He has a history of high blood pressure and asks the technician to confirm that he is taking his medication as prescribed and checking his blood pressures on a regular basis. He states that his medication is in the cupboard, back in the corner, and he has not taken his blood pressure medication for a while. He denies taking it for fear that it will not be effective. He reports that his symptoms have been going on for a few months and has tried various treatment options, including hypnosis, lozenges, chewing gum, and even hypnosis. He continues to smoke about a pack a day. He explains that he will just go out without his wife and buy a cigarette, and the next thing he knows he is buying another cigarette. He is going to try the
PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Decreased vision in the right eye.
- Palpation: No carotid bruits.

Eyes: Examination of the anterior and posterior lid reveals no subluxation.
Neck: General Examination: No clubbing, peristalsis, or guarding.
Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: Tenderness to palpation of the bilateral lower paraspinal gait. No rebound.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray images of the right eye were obtained and reviewed in office today reveal evidence of anterior compartmental haemoglobin A1c is elevated at 7.3 and there is no evidence of any fracture or osteoarthritis. There is development of mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation which is normal for a man with high blood pressure.


These reveal the presence of bony fragmentation which is consistent with atrial fibrinogenation.
Impression: anterior cuspination is present and shows subtle wavy striation.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right eye irritation.
- Medical Reasoning: After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-ray results are consistent with right eye irritation and have been consistent with this for the last 3 to 4 months. We discussed that this is likely caused by optical disc degeneration. I advised the patient that this can be caused by a variety of factors including improper eye alignment, improper eye contact, improper eyeglass prescription use, and smoking. I also advised him that due to his high blood pressure, he should continue to follow up with his primary care physician to check on his blood pressure. The patient was advised that he can continue to take his medication as prescribed, but I want him to start doing a blood pressure check once a day.

[doctor] okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs

[doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though
[patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them

[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight
[doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay

[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you
[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible
[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer
[patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing
[doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to
[patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want
[doctor] what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me

[doctor] alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Kidney stones.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joshua Diaz is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient has been experiencing bilateral right flank pain for the last 2 weeks. His pain starts in the right flank and radiates down to his groin, but he has intermittent bouts where it gets out of control. He rates his pain level as 1-2 out of 10. He denies any nausea or vomiting, but has experienced an episode where the pain radiated to one of his testicles, which he describes as weird. He has been taking ibuprofen for the pain, which has somewhat calms it down, but it persists. He notes that his pain is intermittent and comes and goes depending on how much he has been drinking and what sort of activities he's been doing. He adds that he has had kidney stones in the past, so he usually passes them within a week. He states that his family history is very active and he can blame them for this issue.

Impression: Kidney stone is located in the anterior part of the right proximal process and is obstructed by the anterior mitral regurgitation process.
4
4 views of the bladder are reviewed and reveal no bony fragments.


ASSESSMENT

Right flank kidney stone.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are consistent with kidney stones. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with lithotripsy. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. At that point, if his symptoms have not improved, we may consider performing a CT of the kidney to evaluate for possible location of the stone. If the CT does not reveal a kidney stone, the patient will be referred to a specialist for further treatment."

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Frank Ward is a pleasant 91-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a patient with hematuria. The onset of his symptoms began 1 week ago, however, he had previously experienced these symptoms about 6 months ago when he came in for treatment of coronary artery disease. He underwent surgery for a stent placement in his right coronary artery in 2018. He had a heart attack back in 2018 and underwent quadruple bypass surgery in 2019. The patient has a history of kidney dysfunction stage 3 and was last seen by his nephrologist about 1 month ago. He reports that he has been watching his salt intake over the holidays, but he does not feel his diet has been up to standard. He states that he usually urinates at least once or twice a night. He denies any changes in his urination pattern recently. He continues to use Lasix, which he has increased to 40 mg once a day. He also reports taking Tylenol, which does not provide him with relief. He notes that he is able to sleep with or without pain, but not always lying flat.
PHYSICAL EXAM
Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- The pumping function of the heart was a little low. The ejection fraction was about thirty five%.

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: Tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. CVA tenderness present at right flank. No tenderness at L5 or L6 tenderness tenderness test. No posterior paraspinal tenderness.


objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.

X-ray of the chest was reviewed and revealed a stent in the right coronary artery was placed in April 18th, 2002. There is a low ejection fraction of about 45%.

Previous ECG revealed a mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation which is normal for a heart attack, which is unusual for this stage of the disease and is not seen in these patients.


Lancashire lasix is increased to 45 milligrams once a day, which helps with the bony trombectomy.


ASSESSMENT

1. Shortness of breath.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are consistent with congestive heart failure. We discussed that he had a heart attack back in the year of 2000 and his ejection fraction was about 30%. I have also advised him to watch his salt intake, potassium levels, and avoid citrus fruits. He should also avoid using anti-inflammatory medications such as Tylenol or Motrin as they can increase his risk of kidney failure. I advised the patient to continue to follow up with his nephrologist for further evaluation.
2. Kidney dysfunction about stage 3

The patient states that his potassium levels are low and I want to get a referral to a kidney specialist to evaluate his kidney function.
3. Coronary artery disease

INSTRUCTIONS

We will refer him to a cardiac cath lab to evaluate for possible coronary artery disease."
