[doctor] no it's fine how about your water consumption
[patient] yes but i've been drinking a lot more water and i do realize that i i wake up sometimes during the night to you know use the restroom to pee more than i normally do

[patient] so good yeah
[doctor] okay and are you like watching any other sports like did you watch march madness

[patient] thank you
[doctor] okay but how is school like are you like are are things going well like are you enjoying like your your time there
[patient] yeah school is actually going well gotten good grades
[doctor] nice
[patient] although my my physics teachers socks cheese
[doctor] they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you
[patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days
[doctor] alright
[patient] so
[doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick
[patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway
[doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct
[patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep
[doctor] okay
[patient] sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep
[doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain
[patient] no
[doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerulonephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment
[patient] how much are all these tests going to cost
[doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them
[patient] okay that's that's good to know
[doctor] yes
[patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests
[doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today
[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and right after that i have to go to work
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i
[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh
[patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes
[doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay
[patient] got it
[doctor] alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in
[patient] do i need to get a shot today
[doctor] no shots today just stopped
[patient] okay and when do i have to come back for the results
[doctor] i need you to come back in a week
[patient] okay can we do that over the phone by the way
[doctor] we could if if your results are normal but if we need to have additional conversations i'm gon na need you to come back
[patient] excellent
[doctor] okay
[patient] thank you very much
[doctor] no problem","

ASSESSMENT


1. Recurrent strep.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and strep findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are consistent with recurrent strep and discussed the possibility of a histology to rule out any other contributing factors. We discussed that strep throat is very common in young adults and that although his symptoms do not appear to be related to infection, he should continue to monitor his water consumption carefully. We also discussed that his brother is a smoker and I have advised him not to smoke in the house, but he continues to do so. I also advised him to follow up with me if he gets into trouble with his smoking habits.

[doctor] okay
[patient] alright then
[doctor] i'm just i'm gon na i'm gon na grab your leg we're just gon na take it through just let it relax i'm just gon na take it through a little range of motion i'm gon na kinda poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright now i'm poking i'm poking i'm poking so on the inside part here
[patient] is this where it hurts
[doctor] yeah like when you touch it it really hurts
[patient] right there okay tell me what's worse here or here
[doctor] on the inside
[patient] okay so medial joint line tenderness
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] pes bursa nontender epicondyle nontender back of her knee nice and soft any pain back here
[doctor] no i do n't think so
[patient] okay popliteal space is nontender how about over on this side
[doctor] no okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks
[patient] yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it
[doctor] all the way back
[patient] okay let's see
[doctor] okay
[patient] good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too
[doctor] yeah that's fine
[patient] okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax
[doctor] mm-hmm valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee
[patient] mm-hmm yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me
[doctor] okay
[patient] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts
[doctor] yeah sometimes
[patient] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like
[doctor] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts
[patient] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] you actually no
[doctor] yeah it hurts no
[patient] what about you i mean are you real weak
[doctor] no i would say i'm pretty strong
[patient] did you go to the gym
[doctor] i go to the gym but i swim so the
[patient] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay
[doctor] yes sir work harder okay
[patient] do you do you play sports in in college or high school
[doctor] i did in high school
[patient] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids
[doctor] no
[patient] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog
[doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim
[patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee
[doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that
[patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's pretty bad
[doctor] okay
[patient] we'll get we'll get to that too
[doctor] okay
[patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today
[doctor] yes
[patient] okay do i go into that to
[doctor] yeah
[patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it
[patient] you're only cup of this
[doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up
[patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament
[doctor] okay
[patient] does that make sense
[doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here
[patient] okay
[doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first
[patient] okay
[doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary
[patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work
[patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this
[doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy
[patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right
[doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good
[patient] did you get did you select you last night
[doctor] i did
[patient] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for
[doctor] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful
[patient] are you serious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] rockets
[doctor] i live in dallas yes
[patient] yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls
[doctor] no no
[patient] my gosh alright we're gon na have to work on you
[doctor] okay thanks
[patient] okay
[doctor] bye
[patient] you got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight we'll talk about this later okay
[doctor] yes sir

He thinks he hit a squirrel when he was riding with his partner, who is a little distractible, so he thinks he saw a squirrel and went down and hit the knee. He denies any pain at this time prior to the injury. The patient reports that her knee was not bothering her before that. She works in a children's hospital and enjoys playing around in the NICU and rocking babies. She is married with a dog, so she does not know if she broke up with her partner at the time of her injury.

[patient] it's about a four right now
[doctor] about a four okay so it's it's not too bad alright so we'll take a look at that knee in a second so we're also here to check up on your hypertension and diabetes so i'm looking here for your hypertension you're taking five milligrams of norvasc so are you taking that daily
[patient] yes
[doctor] yes great i i i'm so happy when my patients are compliant most of the times they do n't take it as as often but i'm i'm really excited for that what have your blood pressures been running i think today
[patient] you're about one forty over eighty it's a little bit high but i know we we talked about you getting a blood pressure cuff at home and taking those so i do n't check it very often
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it's usually in the one forties to one fifties range on that top number and then that bottom number is usually around eighty and i read on the google that that's okay is that okay
[doctor] i mean it's it's not the best right it's it's we should be around one twenty over eighty right
[patient] okay
[doctor] you're a little bit elevated and we could talk about changing your medications to try to get that that down how about your diet how's that going
[patient] i eat anything i want
[doctor] alright well we we definitely got ta got ta get your your diet a little bit better i know after the pandemic a lot of people you know went crazy with the diet myself included but i know we got ta get you get back in because for your diabetes i'm looking at your a1c and we we checked it and it was a a seven point two which is not so good right now so have you been taking i think you're on metformin five hundred milligrams daily
[patient] i do but i got ta take it sometimes it upsets my stomach and so i just kinda skip it
[doctor] okay so yeah we definitely got ta get you to to take it we could try something else just if you're having interaction with that medication what about your blood sugars are they taking those daily
[patient] no every once in a while
[doctor] every once in a while what have they been doing every once in a while when when you do take them
[patient] probably about a hundred and fifty or so
[doctor] okay so we got to get those down too so we will talk about getting you consult nutrition just try to get you a better diet i think you know we wan na get you off the medications totally but you know we got ta get you on the right track here alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na check your your your lungs lungs sound good check your heart so listen to your heart you still do have that grade two out of systolic ejection murmur alright but we we knew about that already you've had that for a couple of years so i'm not really worried about that at this at this time so let me take a look at your knee here so when i press right here on the inside the right knee is that painful

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of right knee pain and hypertension and diabetes. He was playing basketball yesterday for the first time in 2 years. He states that he felt his knee pop when he was coming down for a rebound and that it started swelling. He could hardly walk when it happened and he was unable to bear weight on his leg. He describes his pain level as a 4 out of 10. He has tried Tylenol yesterday, which did not help. His swelling has reduced and he slept overnight, so his pain has decreased. He is favoring his right knee. His pain is localized to the inside of his knee and he describes it as stabbing and real achy. He reports that he has a history of a right knee injury prior to this injury. He denies previous knee injuries. The patient states that his hypertension is usually in the 1,500 to 1,600 mmHg range and his diabetes is usually around 80-1,000. He usually checks his blood pressure at home with a blood pressure cuff at home and takes Norvasc 5 mg daily.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Zachary Taylor is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents today for an evaluation of right elbow pain and left arm pain. The onset of his pain began one day ago, however he denies any specific injury. He woke up one day with pain in his left elbow and noticed it since yesterday. He does not know what he did yesterday that might have caused the pain, other than working around the house. He mowed grass yesterday. His last blood sugar result was 7.2% last time and he was on metformin 2.5 mg daily at that time. His blood pressure has been running slightly higher than normal lately, but his BP is still within normal limits. He has been taking Norvasc 2 mg daily, which has been effective for him. He denies taking any other medication for pain, however, he has tried motrin once and reports it has not been effective.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Ears, Nose, Mouth, and Throat

Gastrointestinal
Bilateral Abdomen: Pain to palpation of the bilateral lower extremities.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.


Musculoskeletal
Exam of the left upper extremity reveals no tenderness or guarding to the right radial artery. There is some slight hematoma on the radial radial artery, which may be due to previous treatment. The patient is being seen regularly for this reason. No additional treatment is needed at this time.



RESULTS

Previous hemoglobin A1c is reviewed at 7.2


Abdominal x-ray of the right elbow is unremarkable.

Impression: Abdomenitis A

Echocardiogram demonstrates decreased ejection fraction of 45%, abnormal diastolic blood pressure, and elevated hemoglobin B1c, which is unusual for a diabetics.


Previous x-rays of the left arm are inconclusive.




Right elbow acetabulum is slightly elevated, probably due to decreased bony alignment.
Previous X-rays reveal no fractures.


ASSESSMENT


1. Left elbow pain

2. Hypertension

3. Diabetes

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and notes today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. We will order a repeat MRI of the left elbow for further evaluation.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve with the MRI, we will consider adding another medication to his current regimen, such as Motrin.

[doctor] okay okay you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past like what were they
[patient] so i i had a doc gave me some injections before i'm not sure what they were though
[doctor] okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective
[patient] no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it
[doctor] okay but did the did the exercises help
[patient] i mean i guess a little
[doctor] okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications

[patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis
[doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad
[patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though
[doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking
[patient] what type of smoking
[doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but
[patient] okay
[doctor] have you smoked
[patient] next maybe that i have n't
[doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before
[patient] okay i smoked
[doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it
[patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked
[doctor] okay you have
[patient] too many questions are you the fit
[doctor] i'm your doctor i have to
[patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question
[doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things
[patient] sent them off yeah
[doctor] pardon
[patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen
[doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt
[patient] yeah it hurts
[doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt
[patient] a little bit
[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up
[patient] stop
[doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the
[patient] what does that mean like am i dying
[doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay
[patient] that's a big word
[doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something
[patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that
[doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] can i get pain pills too
[doctor] can you
[patient] for pain
[doctor] can you get what now
[patient] pain pills
[doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have
[patient] i'd say it was n't effective
[doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective
[patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked
[doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery
[patient] i do n't want i know
[doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] do you have any questions
[patient] no
[doctor] alright
[patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection
[doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions
[patient] no
[doctor] okay thank you","
CHIEF COMPLAINT

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Steven Taylor is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The onset of his pain began 2 years ago, when he bumped into a wall while playing basketball and fell on his back. He denies any specific injury. The patient states that he has tried a couple of different treatments, but nothing seems to work. He describes his pain as being around a 7 out of 10. His symptoms are sharp, throbbing, and sometimes it radiates down his left leg. He states that lying on his side makes his pain worse, while standing makes it worse. He also reports some numbness in his left lower extremities, and a loss of control of his bowels. He has a family history of smoking and drinking.


SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he plays basketball at home all day. He is not very active and has gained about 80 pounds in the past year. He reports that his wife smokes and his brother is known to have smoked.


PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally

Cardiovascular


Lumbar spine ultrasound

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of Abdomen: Mild tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant.

Skin
- There is some skin loss down the left side of the spine, but not to a great extent. There is also some skin thickening over the right posterior quadrant, which may be due to radiation therapy. The skin thickens slightly in the right and left lateral regions of the back.


RESULTS


X-ray images of the spine were obtained and reviewed in office today.

Impression: Significant weight gain in the past year

Periodic yelp: Not effective

Abdominal x-rays of the left lower extremity are reviewed and reveal no evidence of any fractures or osteoarthritis.




IMPRESSION

Previous X-rays did not reveal any fractures in the lower extremities.
Perform physical therapy at his house were ineffective.
Impressive results: No fractures.


ASSESSMENT

• Back pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a herniated disc. We discussed the possibility of additional testing, such as a lithotripsy, but the patient is not in a position to proceed at this time. I recommended that we obtain an MRI of the entire back to rule out any other contributing issues. I also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen his lower extremities. All questions were answered to his satisfaction.
INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks."
aci,ACI019,"[doctor] hey angela how are you
[patient] i'm good how are you
[doctor] i'm good so i see we are here you had a recent diagnosis of stage three non-small cell lung cancer and so we are following up on your neo adevant chemotherapy so you can you tell me how you're doing today
[patient] yeah you know i'm i'm doing okay i have a little bit of some shortness of breath that i noticed over the weekend and you know i i'm i considered myself pretty active before this i would walk my dog around the block and now i i ca n't even walk you know down the street without being short of breath
[doctor] okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs
[patient] i mean i would i would take them for i would normally take them for like mile long walks everyday and just this weekend i could only walk down to the end of the street i had to have my husband take the dog fit walk
[doctor] man okay what kind of dog do you have
[patient] i have a dobrman
[doctor] yeah they are pretty active that makes sense alright so have you been coughing have you had any phlegm
[patient] i've been having a dry cough no phlegm
[doctor] okay have you noticed any fever
[patient] no fever
[doctor] no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain
[patient] well i mean now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful
[doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck
[patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts
[doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids
[patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake
[doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though
[patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them
[doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of cisplatin and etoposide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that
[patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay
[doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation pneumonitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five gray yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before
[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight
[doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so we will get you those medications those prescriptions and then we will see you back in two weeks
[patient] okay great thank you

[patient] i have but sometimes i forget i'm i'm embarrassed to tell you that but yeah sometimes i forget i get busy like especially on the weekends i'm very good during the week but on the weekends i tend to forget it and that's when i'm most busy too
[doctor] yeah well i'm also curious you know you have diabetes have you been checking your blood sugar
[patient] yeah i have because i thought maybe you know that's why i'm getting the headaches maybe my sugar was too low or maybe too high but my sugar has been okay it's been running like one twenty sometimes it does get down to like one hundred
[doctor] okay and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that
[patient] not really so much it's it's been pretty much the same but pretty normal
[doctor] okay and when you get these headaches what are you taking for them
[patient] well i take my tylenol hoping it'll just you know go away and then it does some just for a little bit but then it it just goes throughout the day and i start to get them again
[doctor] okay and when you first had the headaches what would you rate the headache at zero no pain ten the worst pain ever
[patient] i would say when i first get them it's about i would say a seven out of ten
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then after you take the tylenol what does it go down to
[patient] it goes down to probably about a four maybe five it i still feel it i still feel annoying but it's not as pounding as as it normally would be

[doctor] okay yeah so you want
[patient] i did n't know what high potassium foods are
[doctor] okay i'm sorry i've never talked to you about that in the past i that's my fault so yeah so you wan na make sure you stay away from things like bananas oranges you know potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing and so you know because with your kidney function you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you do n't get rid of the potassium as you should you know
[patient] something to eat

[patient] i said yeah too bad they did
[doctor] yeah alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you okay so you know looking at your vital signs here in the office you know your your blood pressure is about one thirty five over eighty so it's it's not too bad and maybe like to see it a little bit lower i'm just gon na be calling out my physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so on your neck exam i appreciate some jugular venous distention up to about nine centimeters there are no carotid bruits on your lung exam i do appreciate bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when you cough on your heart exam i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally so frank what does that mean all that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're retaining fluid now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that okay so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you okay so for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath i do believe you're having a an acute heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix from forty milligrams a day to eighty milligrams a day and i want you to call me in two days and let me know how your weight has been with increasing the diuretic now if you start to have worsening shortness of breath before that i want you to yeah call me we may have to admit you to the hospital for some intravenous diuretics okay i also wan na go ahead and just obtain
[patient] salt on lasix all at once am i take it all at once or do i divide it up
[doctor] how about you start taking the the increased dose in the morning and then we'll see how you do and if necessary i'll have to add a second dose in the afternoon that you can take around four o'clock in the afternoon i do n't want you to take it too late at night because then you will be going to the bathroom all night okay
[patient] that sounds correct
[doctor] so i also want to go ahead and order a chest x-ray just to make sure that we are not missing anything else okay for your second problem of your coronary artery disease you know it sounds like you're doing well except for this heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and order another echocardiogram to check out that heart murmur that i hear on your physical exam just to make sure that that's not getting any worse and to make sure that the pumping function of your heart is stable and i'm gon na go ahead and call doctor white and let them know that i want you to be seen by them okay okay and then for your third problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i want you to go ahead and try to you know do n't please do n't take anymore motrin or advil i do want you to try to stick with tylenol and if you're still having a significant problem with with some pain i want you to call me and we'll talk about some alternative medications that we can use or therapies okay i will also want to go ahead and order a complete metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable does that sound okay
[patient] that sounds good do you have any idea what was going on with my foot pain before
[doctor] well how long have you been having it how long you've been having that foot pain
[patient] that's why i took the motrin it lasted you know four five days slowly went away

[patient] just in front of the big toe
[doctor] just in front of the big toe okay have you ever had a history of gout
[patient] nobody has told me about that
[doctor] okay alright well it sounds like it could've been gout you know with your chronic kidneys chronic kidney disease it it's a possibility so for this possible gout flare for your fourth problem of your possible gout flare let's go ahead i wan na just go ahead and order a uric acid just to see and it's something that we can talk about there is an alternative medication that you can take with your kidney function that that would n't hurt it that would n't injure it any further and i think it would work just the same
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay any other questions
[patient] just as long as you think i'm gon na get better
[doctor] i think you're gon na get better yes i think we're gon na you know i really want you to watch your salt intake and i'm gon na go ahead and order that dietary dietitian referral so that you can get your diet under control but you really have to watch your salt intake i think that that's kind of what this heart failure exacerbation is about maybe a little dietary indiscretion
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] yeah no that's good thank you
[doctor] okay you're welcome bye","
CHIEF COMPLAINT

Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Frank Jones is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of shortness-of- breath. The onset of his symptoms began approximately 6 months ago, when he was referred by his primary care physician. His symptoms improved after they increased his lasix dose and he seemed to get better. The patient reports that he feels short of breath mostly when he is walking around or ambling up stairs. He notes that he urinates at least once and sometimes twice a night. He has a history of a coronary artery disease and had a stent placed in his right coronary artery in 2018. He reports that his ejection fraction was about 30% at the time of the stent placement. He states that he has been watching his salt intake over the last couple of weeks, but notes that there has been a lot of family get-togethers and he does not think his diet has been everything it should have been. He is concerned with high potassium levels in his diet, and notes that bananas and potatoes have been a source of potassium for him. He also reports that at night he has difficulty lying flat

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are similar to those of a viral infection. We discussed the nature of the infection, as well as the possibility of developing pneumonia, and that this could be the source of her developing a severe norovirus. We also discussed the potential side effects of this infection, such as pneumonia, which could include blood clots, heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, cardiac arrest, and death. Additionally, the patient was advised to monitor her blood glucose levels daily and discontinue metformin, which she has been doing well with. I advised her to increase her dose of hydrochlorothiazide from 5 to 7 mg once a day to 10 mg daily, and to continue taking Tylenol as needed for pain and fever. I also recommended that the patient obtain a bilateral bilateral breast cystoscopy to evaluate for possible perforation. If she does not have these, we will consider performing a bilateral echocardiogram to assess for breast cysts."

[patient] most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that i have to maybe play less play less or or skip a day
[doctor] yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right
[patient] correct
[doctor] okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound
[patient] i do n't think so anything that i need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things
[doctor] yeah you know be sure you're staying well hydrated you know six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you you know when when it warms up you're certainly gon na prespire more and lose lose more fluid so so i would i would recommend that you continue to have you know a a standard six to eight glasses of of fluid intake per day but yeah that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated you might wan na increase that if you have an increased activity level so alright any other questions for me
[patient] how much beer should i drink
[doctor] probably not the best thing with you know with with with your high blood pressure fluctuating the way it is so not more than a couple drinks a week hate to tell you
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright okay great seeing you we'll see you back see you in a couple of weeks you take care","

aci,ACI063,"[doctor] good afternoon matthew how are you
[patient] i'm okay
[doctor] it looks like here that the that you've been brought in for some vision changes and looks like you're having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today
[patient] yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment
[doctor] okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on
[patient] well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me
[doctor] okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street
[patient] my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was
[doctor] it was
[patient] it was just phenomenal
[doctor] it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon
[patient] yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for
[doctor] i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day
[patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped
[doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis
[patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it
[doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me
[patient] okay that's a bright light
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection
[patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] well
[patient] what i mean not not yeah literally stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] yeah literally yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection
[patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good
[doctor] okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes
[patient] okay thank you very much
[doctor] thank you","

Left-sided low back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sean Williams is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents for an evaluation of left-sided lower back pain following a microdiscectomy in November of 2014. He was highly dosed up on Gabapentin at the time of his surgery and describes his pain as unpleasant and difficult to withdraw from. He has a history of lower extremity pain following previous back surgeries.


SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports living with his significant other, who advises him to stretch. He reports that this has been helpful in relieving his pain. He also reports that he has a lot of bending over due to his spinal deformity. He states that he randomly experiences pain on the left side as well as the left-hand side of his back. He denies right-hand pain with extension, bending forward, or with weight bearing.

ASSESSMENT

• Right side low back pain


PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left side of his back to assess for possible contributory causes of his lower back pain. We discussed the possibility of a herniated disc, but the most likely diagnosis is a misalignment of the cervical spine due to tightness in the lumbar fascia. The patient was highly dosed up on gabapentin at the time of his surgery and I advised him to reduce his dosage. I also recommended that he attend formal physical therapy to strengthen his lower extremities.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review."
aci,ACI068,"[doctor] hey betty how're you
[patient] i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having for a few weeks now

[patient] i you know i ca n't think about anything specifically but i am very active and i also have been renovating my basement so i have been doing a lot with that
[doctor] wow okay and do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything
[patient] no no trauma that i can think of at all
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do n't remember hitting it either
[doctor] okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
[patient] you know i'm active and will have aches and pains here and there but nothing that some tylenol ca n't take care of
[doctor] okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder
[patient] it is
[doctor] okay are you able to move that left arm for me
[patient] you know anytime i try reaching for something or lifting anything i have a lot of pain and i do n't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it it really hurts
[doctor] okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go
[patient] it's all the time and if there is any pressure like when i try to sleep at night i ca n't even lay i'm a side sleeper and it i really gives me a hard time because i'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there
[doctor] okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all
[patient] i ca n't
[doctor] alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side
[patient] i mean it's always there but when i sleep directly on it the pain goes up
[doctor] okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol and i'll take two extra strengths tylenol every six to eight hours
[doctor] okay
[patient] and it does help take the edge off
[doctor] okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level
[patient] without any tylenol i would say my pain is like a three
[doctor] okay and then with tylenol with that
[patient] i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three
[doctor] okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift
[patient] yeah it just time we've been living in this house for some time now and you know with the pandemic we've been home and so decided to do some work

[patient] yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away
[doctor] i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do

[doctor] yeah i say the same thing to my husband okay well let's go ahead i wanted you to just do a quick physical exam so i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so looking here at your vital signs you know you do n't have a fever here in the office which is good your temperature is ninety eight . four on your blood pressure it seems like you are doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure your blood pressure is right where it should be it's about one twenty five over sixty two which is good your heart rate is nice and slow in the eighties and your oxygenation is fine it's ninety seven percent on room air so all of that is is really good now on on your facial exam i'm just pressing on your face here do you have any pain to palpation
[patient] just right underneath my eyes
[doctor] on one on what side
[patient] actually both
[doctor] okay okay on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam there are there is erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam can you open up your mouth on your throat exam the the uvula is midline there is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsillar space on neck examination i do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and on your lung exam there is coarse rhonchi present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when i press here
[patient] yep

[patient] little bit yeah
[doctor] okay so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated ecchymosis to the right medial knee there is no evidence of an effusion okay so billy what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your in your lungs which we will talk about okay and then and as far as your knee exam it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues okay so for your first problem of your cough you know i do believe that you just have a a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis i really just wan na go ahead and just you know recommend some supportive care you can continue to take over the counter medications we can prescribe guaifenesin six hundred six hundred milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good
[doctor] okay so for your second problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have a a a right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning and i really wan na just go ahead and and i'll prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area and i'm gon na go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did n't injure any bones although i do n't think you did but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray how does that sound

aci,ACI083,"[doctor] well good morning emily how are you
[patient] good morning
[doctor] how are you doing
[patient] doing okay i'm okay
[doctor] i understand you're having some sudden visual distortions and some blurring of your vision is that right
[patient] it is yes
[doctor] okay so what's going on
[patient] sorry to put you off i do n't think i have that script
[doctor] oh
[patient] maybe a different one i wonder if patient has history of
[doctor] macular degeneration yeah yeah i was because we do n't we do n't to do the intro anymore i was just going with that you you're coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring of vision so i'll just you know i'll just say i'll just go ahead and go into this technician part so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right
[patient] it is yes
[doctor] okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks
[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused
[doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you
[patient] yeah and whenever i take my husband out to a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights
[doctor] uh okay so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to
[patient] i do mcdonalds is one of my favorite here in arlington
[doctor] that sounds good what what do you what's your favorite there
[patient] they have a great egg plant parmajon one of my favorite so i just go ahead and go with that
[doctor] that sounds really nice very good
[patient] it's just
[doctor] yeah okay well so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day
[patient] yes i tried to stop smoking every now and then but it's still been hard to totally stop
[doctor] okay and how is your blood pressure been doing are you keeping up with your medication
[patient] i take my blood pressure when i can remember to do so
[doctor] okay yeah it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly i'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly so okay well let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay so the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no mvi pciol cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees without any tears or holes rpe changes in the fovea posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula thickening of the retina presence of subretinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no mvi cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage or subretinal fluid retina is attached okay so i reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct so it shows drusen deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium subretinal fluid accumulation choroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescein angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration so the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hints the name wet amd and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of lucentes once a month it's injected into the vitreous portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions
[patient] i do not no that sounds great

[doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you
[patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there
[doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating
[patient] not really

[patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists
[doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten
[patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten
[doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad
[patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away
[doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you

[doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in
[patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender
[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you
[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible
[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Kidney stones.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joshua Diaz is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents today for the evaluation of a kidney stone. The patient reports that he has been having right flank and groin pain for the last 2 weeks. He describes the pain as intermittent, but notes that it does not last long. The pain radiates down to his groin and he has bouts where it gets out of control. He rates his pain level as 1-2 out of 10. He denies any nausea, vomiting, chills, or fevers. He has had kidney stones in the past and has had to have surgery a couple of times. He notes that his family has a history of kidney stones.


The patient has been taking ibuprofen for his pain, which has somewhat calms the pain down. He states that he usually manages to get the pain under control within a week. He believes that his pain is in the order of 2-4 out of ten.


The patient denies blood in his urine, but admits that he did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of his testicles.


PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally


Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of Abdomen: There is no pain to palpation of the right flank or the groin. There is mild swelling on the right side of the abdomen, which is normal for a 1+ man.
- Blood Pressure: Elevated at the 4/6 level bilaterally, probably due to the pain.


Gastrointestinal

- Palpation: No tenderness or guarding of the periumbilical nerves.


RESULTS


X-ray of the abdomen is reviewed and reveals a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm2 in size.

Impression: #####EMPTY#####.
Abdomenoscopy of the right flank and groin revealed a stone the size of a golf ball.



Periodic urination revealed no evidence of any abnormalities.



Perineural effusion was reviewed and revealed normal levels of creatinine and hemoglobin A1c, hemoglobin B1c and HDL, which are normal for a healthy kidney.
ThumbnailImage

Rapid strep test revealed no changes in renal function.


ASSESSMENT

Right flank kidney stone.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are consistent with kidney stones. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with a low dose of oxycodone 5 mg every 6 hours to hopefully get the pain under control. If the drug does not work, we will consider performing a kidney stone ultrasound which would reveal the location of the kidney stone and would result in the patient being admitted to the hospital to be seen by a kidney specialist. All of the symptoms the patient is currently experiencing are likely related to his renal function and his inability to pass the stone on his own.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joe Allen is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury, sustained over the weekend. He states he was skiing with friends when he felt a pop in his right knee. He sustained a mild swelling and pain. He denies pain with flexion or extension. His symptoms include swelling, right knee pain, and right knee fatigue. The onset of his pain began approximately halfway through his skis and he could feel a pop. The pain intensified as he dug into the snow with the front end of the skis. The patient states he could not see as as the two paths kind of came together and he ended up doing a cart wheel. He developed swelling and a pain in the right knee, which he describes as “severely painful” at the time of his symptoms. He is currently in Mount Saint Helen and Washington DC, where he was just walking around by himself. He enjoys hiking and mountain biking in the area, so he is unsure if he would like to do some physical therapy at this time of year as he does not have time for that.

ASSESSMENT

Right ankle sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed an acute sprain of the right ankle. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that the patient be placed in an Aircast for 5 to 7 days to help with her pain and swelling. She will remain non-weight-bearing for 1 to 2 days, and then may be able to tolerate some weight-bearing as well as some non-steroid NSAIDs. At that point, the patient can choose to start taking Tylenol or NSAIDs as needed to treat her pain."
