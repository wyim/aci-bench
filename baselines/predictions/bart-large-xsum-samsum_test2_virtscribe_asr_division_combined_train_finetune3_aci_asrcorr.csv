virtscribe,VS001,"[doctor] alright new patient jordan roberts date of birth 3/2/1972 . he is a 49-year-old with hypertension and palpitations please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1 , 2021 mr. roberts doing today i'm fine thank you good so i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations yeah that was back in march i think but my girlfriend and i we talked about it and on that day i had a few cups of coffee and no breakfast so i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else since so tell me about the blood pressure issues my blood pressure since i was young family history of this family does have high blood pressure i see . [patient] yeah i thought i was getting better and have a new primary doctor and she put me on a new medication about a month ago . [doctor] can you tell me which medications you are taking ? [patient] my new med is a combo med something 4025 . [doctor] okay yes this is at your chart the benicar hct it has hydrochlorothiazide in it yet that sent my water pill i call it okay are you still taking the amlodipine 10 mg daily yes i am . [patient] that's that's a good start regimen are you checking your blood pressure at home and if yes what numbers are you seeing ? [doctor] every day . [patient] awesome . [doctor] yeah every morning i take it when i get up and been running about 1:46 to 1:55 lately . not down in the 120s yet no not yet while we are trying to get there though okay how are you doing with your salt intake charted back off of it i think i'm doing good with it not eating too much good i play huge part in lowering your pressure and staying away from salt is important information on the–eating plan which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure sounds good are you doing any exercise i do try and walk on the treadmill when i can okay great so let's take a look throughout your exam just like you make sure i get everything documented okay . please use my general physical exam template let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good . [patient] alright . [doctor] your heart and lungs sound good so that's great . [patient] good to hear . [doctor] alright go ahead and lie down and let me know if anywhere i press hurts . no , nowhere . alright , so i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling . [patient] alright . [doctor] so in terms of getting that pressure down you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down and the question is what do we need to do to get your . [patient] to get it down . your potassium 1 week ago was 4.0 has it been redone since in the last week ? [doctor] no . okay for is good for your potassium level some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in the body often it is a form response if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age 8 out of 10 would respond to reduce salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure but for the 2 out of 10 there is something else driving parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands over produce aldosterone which we call hyperaldosterone okay so is there is something we can do about it in these cases there is medicine called spironolactone that is very effective at dropping the aldosterone level and your blood pressure and i think we should give that a try i mean i'm willing to give it a try okay so lets discuss the piss of the possible risks of being on hydrochlorothiazide thiazide which is the fluid meds that you're now on and the spironolactone one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance they can also cause dehydration so when as you got to make sure that you hydrate you do not hydrate and you get dehydrated you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up second thing is this spironolactone can raise your potassium too far is rare but it can you're starting with your potassium at four so that gives us some room to feel a bit better and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrochlorothiazide chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down now this does not meet mean that you need to be eating more salt okay but it does mean that you will need to do blood test in 2 weeks to make sure that it's okay . alright that i can do are there any other side effects i need to worry about ? [patient] dizziness possibly as well as one in 100 guys might develop . [doctor] tenderness in the chest swollen breasts are enlarged breast this is a rare side effect called gynecomastia and if it happens you just cut the medication and you let me know but it is very uncommon . [patient] i'll definitely let you know that happens okay we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better it can be tricky and your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age . [doctor] though it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure can eventually lead to heart failure . [patient] i understand . [doctor] yes of getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure strokes and things like that that you are at high risk for with high blood pressure okay . the american heart association has a website called heart.it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days that could be 7-10 points of your blood pressure really relieve gait is very important to be active lower your salt and increase your potassium the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 mg a day the actual recommendation is is 1500 mg/day but most people have a hard time with that so just take a look at the website and the–diet information that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning stuff i'll definitely check that out so we will try the spironolactone and schedule follow-up in 2 weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes if the new med does n't work the next step is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic so there they we'll look into secondary causes of your hypertension they have access to newer procedure-based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication for example there is something called a renal denervation where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up when they do that they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure . that's interesting . [patient] yeah , so that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate but we will cross that road when we need to and let's just . [doctor] medication risper we will see you in 2 weeks then sounds good thanks doc you're welcome any questions we'll do . [patient] have a great day mr. roberts . [doctor] you too . [patient] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension he is on three meds and maximum dose . [doctor] i have added spironolactone to his regimen . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he'll have a basic metabolic panel and blood pressure check in 2 weeks . next medication would be carvedilol which i have tried to avoid given its potential for erectile dysfunction i have talked to the patient about that and the potential side effects of spironolactone including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances if he is not controlled on spironolactone the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","

His potassium level was 4.0. He is still taking the amlodipine 10 mg daily. He has been running about 1:46-1:55 km/h for the last week. There is a risk of hypoalbuminosis due to the combination of these meds. He should try to reduce salt in his diet and stay away from salt. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Hypertension.committed to emergency room in March with high blood pressure and some palpitations. He is currently on a new medication, hydrochlorothiazide thiazide 4025 mg daily. He was referred to this medication by his primary care physician due to concerns with his previous medication, Amlodipine 10 mg daily, which he discontinued about a month ago. The patient is concerned about the side effects of the new medication including dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, and increased blood pressure. We discussed the risks associated with this medication, such as dependence on it, as well as the potential for dizziness and dizziness. We also discussed the benefits of spironolactone, which are discussed below. I advised the patient that if his blood pressure does not improve over the next 2 weeks, he will need to start a third medication, something similar to Lasix 4025, to increase his potassium levels. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his levels. If his levels do not improve, we will discuss further treatment options including additional monitoring with a blood pressure cuff. If he continues to have elevated blood pressure, we may need to consider adding a fourth medication,"
virtscribe,VS005,"[doctor] mrn 49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate . hi , how are you doing jacqueline ? [patient] i'm pretty good . how are you ? [doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we are under good control right now . [patient] yes , it's doing much better . [doctor] good , good . do you have any rash left over ? [patient] yeah , i have a , a small bit left over . i started using doxycycline only once a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better to just limit it to once a day . [doctor] okay , that sounds good . [patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lot of improvement . [doctor] okay . [patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better , so it's kinda plateaued a little bit . [doctor] i see are you breast-feeding at this time ? [patient] no , not right now . [doctor] okay , good . so you , you should not be breast-feeding while you're on that medication . [patient] yeah , actually i stopped breast-feeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time . [doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [patient] okay and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it , i got worried , so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see . okay , so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses long term after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . okay , i did n't realize that . [doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [patient] okay , then i can resume taking , taking the doxycycline twice a day again . [doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using and then we will look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash how frequently are you using that one ? [patient] twice a day . [doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [patient] no , that's fine . [doctor] okay , and you're using the metrocream ? [patient] yes . [doctor] how often are you using that one ? [patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream . [doctor] okay and then are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [patient] no . [doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [patient] i'm not . [doctor] okay , and no neutrogena wipes ? [patient] no wipes . [doctor] okay . and then what about any lotions that you're using ? [patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two . [doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in a lotion to just help moisturize , but we will see . [patient] okay . [doctor] and then again when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [patient] that was last week , so the first 2 weeks i did twice a day . [doctor] okay . [patient] and then i started seeing improvement and then i changed to just once a day . [doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing you're fitzpatrick skin type iv meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to suntan essentially 4-5 . [patient] and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . yeah . [doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day everyday with the doxycycline . [patient] okay . [doctor] but i would pick up the elidel too . [patient] okay , i can do that . [doctor] i mean i have known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [patient] it is , okay . [doctor] the doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn it will make you sunburn even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [patient] yeah , i mean i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions with wearing a hat and all that , [doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [patient] yes , i did , thank you . [doctor] alright , but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [patient] yeah , i did check , the insurance is not covering it . [doctor] it's not , okay . [patient] well , let's look around really quick because if you use goodrx coupon , it will be around $ 30- $ 40 or something . okay . let's see , so with your coupon it was around $ 850 or something . yeah that's way too much . i agree and , and because i also looked at the urethra , that you recommended in my notes and if it is still if it's still expensive , i could try that instead . [doctor] yeah so it actually it is actually more expensive , i think the prices fluctuate . [patient] okay . [doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 and when i looked before , it was around $ 30- $ 40 . [patient] yeah , if it was around $ 200 , i would have picked it up , but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance . [doctor] okay . so instead of the cream form , we could try ointment form . [patient] you mean the tacromilius ? [doctor] yeah , mm-hmm . [patient] okay . [doctor] so if we send it to pick and save the metro market , let's see where else . [patient] can you do the metro market ? [doctor] yeah , lem me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . [patient] sure . [doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . [patient] okay , but it's not a steroid , right ? [doctor] correct , it's not a steroid . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kind of like a steroid and then it calms inflammation . [patient] okay . [doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face for sure as they'll make this kind of rash worse , but also steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin . [patient] alright . [doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning in the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . the thing to know is that sometimes 5 to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle like sensation . or make it redder or flush but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad . [patient] okay , got it . [doctor] so it only lasts a couple of seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ? [patient] okay , thank you for explaining . [doctor] so i will say apply to rash on face twice daily until resolved . [patient] okay , so only apply to the rash area ? [doctor] yes and keep using the face wash. [patient] okay . [doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day just because i do n't want to dry your skin out too much , okay ? [patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it . [doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't want to create other problems for you . [patient] alright . i will just wash once a day with it but it was feeling very good like there is this little bit of moisture getting back in with the other wash when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out , but not with this one . [doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day . [patient] that sounds good . [doctor] so to review continue using the same face wash , continue with metrocream and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day . [patient] okay . [doctor] and then just do it until it's gone and then do it once a day for another week before stopping . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] alright and i'll rewrite your instructions here . [patient] thank you so much . [doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ? [patient] okay . [doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk , we're not gon na have you on this forever , and especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly . [patient] sounds good . [doctor] alright and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write that out like that , so twice a day until rash is gone and then once a day for another week before stopping . [patient] okay . [doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . continue doxycycline another week and then stop , but you can keep using the wash and the metrocream . [patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that . [doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . if it's starting to flare again , [patient] if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the doxycycline as well . alright . [doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but you know if it does , you have the tools then you will be seeing me for a follow-up , we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ? [patient] yes , sounds good . [doctor] do you have enough refills ? [patient] yeah , i think so . [doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one . [patient] yes , i do . [doctor] alright , and i'll cancel the elidel cream just so we do n't complicate your list . you have plenty of the face wash dull . [patient] yes . [doctor] okay . i will get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well . [patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ? [doctor] yeah , so for that , i would do something really basic like vanicream or even if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a follow-up in about 4 weeks . [patient] okay , thank you . [doctor] okay , and i would stay away from any kind of antiaging thing , any kind of plant thing , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , so reach out to me if you're gon na try something else let's go get those samples . [patient] okay that sounds good . [doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea including ocular rosacea and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleansers such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .","

objective_results: #####EMPTY#####.7071070710#. The patient's skin is in good shape. There is no evidence of any cancer-causing bacteria or viruses. The current oral contraceptive pill is safe and effective in its current form. It is used in really high doses after heart transplant or kidney transplant. It can be used in long-term immuno-suppression therapy. It does not affect the immune system. The risk of developing cancers is low. The drug is biologic in nature. It may be used after transplantation or in combination with other immunotherapy. There are no known side-effects. 
ASSESSMENT AND PLANningJacqueline Miller is currently doing well on doxycycline. The patient wishes to continue taking the medication once a day. We discussed the risks associated with the oral form of the medication, such as skin irritation, eczema, and possible allergic reactions. We also discussed the benefits and drawbacks of this medication, including its use in really high doses long term after people have had a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that. I explained to the patient that the risks are limited to the cream or ointment form and not the long-term use of the medicine. She can keep using the elidel cream and should apply it every 6 to 8 hours. I advised her to stop breast-feeding while she is on the medication. I also recommended that she use the metrocream twice a day and use Neutrogena wipes only a few times per day. If her rash does not improve, we will consider adding in a lotion to help moisturize."

[doctor] okay . good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ? [patient] yes , yes , i am . [doctor] okay , good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ? [patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening where i run anywhere from like 130-145 or 150/95-100 on the bottom . [doctor] okay . [patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here , it's always high , but then it goes down . in the mornings , it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be . [doctor] uh uh . [patient] hmmm also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening . [doctor] yeah so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we want to be . [patient] right . [doctor] mm-hmm . okay . well , let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here . [patient] okay . [doctor] use my general exam template . alright , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath , or sore throat ? no . any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ? [patient] nope . [doctor] have you received your corona virus vaccine ? [patient] yes on february 9 . [doctor] okay great alright well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . alright , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking . your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you . yeah , i agree with that . they will let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol thereby cutting down the urges . [patient] the urge to drink or they constant thinking about it ? [doctor] it actually will help with both . [patient] okay , so is it like a one time thing ? [doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill but the shot does tend to work a bit better . [patient] yeah , i have taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with the shot , it's not like you can undoke it . [doctor] yeah , that's true and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse . [patient] yeah , sure , sure . [doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i said , the research on it is pretty good . [patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before . [doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have . [patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form , then i'm almost certain i tried it before . [doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead and get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17 for your first shot . does that sound good ? [patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ? [doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxiety , anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days . [patient] okay . [doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you're doing . [patient] alright , that sounds good . [doctor] alright , great , well otherwise , stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you received the first dose . [patient] alright , sounds good . thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . have a good rest of your day . [patient] you too . [doctor] miss taylor is drinking alcohol 4 to 5 days/week to excess . no tobacco , no substance abuse . skin is moist . good trigger . on exam , she is alert , pleasant , in no acute distress . she is not diabetic . there is no tremor . no cva tenderness . chest clear to percussion in a suscultation . unlabored breathing . cardiac rhythm regular . no murmur , no gallop . jv flat with a head at 90 degrees . she does not appear anxious , agitated , or depressed . my impression , alcohol use disorder . she would like to start naltrexone which we have previously discussed . she will take the injectable form and start on may 17 . we reviewed side effects and risks , the potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons . hypertension , she is taking lisinopril 10 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily . quite possibly her blood pressure will improve completely with cessation of alcohol . her target bp is 130-140/70-80 . i will see her back week of june 14 which is likely around the time of her second naltrexone injection . i recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and shingrix . # 2 , she did defer this .","

ASSESSMENT AND PLANAmanda Taylor is a 72-year-old woman who presents for follow-up for hypertension. Her blood pressure was 130/90 at her last visit on April 16. At that time, she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once daily. She is currently taking lisinopril 20 mg daily. The patient's blood pressure fluctuates between 130/95-145 on the upper end of the target range and 150/95 on the lower end. At this point, I want to see how her recent blood pressure readings compare to her previous levels. I have recommended that she stop drinking alcohol and reduce her alcohol consumption. She will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess her progress. If her blood pressure continues to increase, we will discuss further treatment options including additional monitoring and possible intervention such as a blood pressure titration. If she continues to have elevated blood pressure, we may need to consider adding additional medications such as metformin or metronidazole. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction. She understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."

[patient] she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement such as citrucel daily . [doctor] probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed , but not started . hello how are you ? [patient] i'm okay . [doctor] good how have you been feeling ? [patient] not so good . [doctor] yeah so my nurse told me you have been going out to . eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp . [patient] yeah , i have . [doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that . [patient] no , it does n't like it at all . [doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea . [patient] i've been getting both . [doctor] okay so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ? [patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day . [doctor] okay and are they soft stools or formed stools ? [patient] they are formed . [doctor] okay and after you have gone out , either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ? [patient] yeah , i do . [doctor] okay . do you feel it's a food or the alcohol or both ? [patient] well usually we go to fridays , restaurant , i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo . [doctor] okay , i can , i can say alfredo sauce . [patient] but it normally does n't bother me . [doctor] okay . well pasta can make you bloated but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chicken grilled chicken is usually alright . alfredo though it's higher in fat and it does contain dairy but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you're there ? is it a sweet drink ? [patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer petroleum , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . every now and again , i'll drink a martini . [doctor] sometimes it's a mixture they tend to put in the drinks but it can be a variety of things so when you're not eating out or drinking what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular so when it does flare up it it might not be as bad . have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ? [patient] no , i guess i need to find a new drink . [doctor] okay and how is it during the week ? [patient] like what i eat . [doctor] yeah and with the diarrhea and abdominal pain , abdominal pain . [patient] right now i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today though . [doctor] and was everything alright after that ? [patient] yeah , for the most part . [doctor] okay . remember it's also the portion sizes , so i mean if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay , you have to just really watch the portions . [patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out , go without some fried chicken at least once in a while . [doctor] sounds good . alright , well , let's take a look at you today and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions and we will discuss once we have finished the exam . [patient] sounds good . [doctor] alright . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . alright , i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . alright so if you could just lay back for me and i'll examine your abdomen . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , do you have any tenderness ? [patient] no , not really . [doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , nontender . no masses or organomegaly and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . alright , you can go ahead and sit up now , thank you . so first i want you to try citrucel , it does come in a tablet you should use it twice daily for regularity then i would say if you know you're going out and possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 mg. you can do 1 tablet before you eat and then repeat up to four times daily . [patient] and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine . okay , that sounds good . [doctor] okay , and so your bentyl that's the antispasm medication and i would take the higher dose . [patient] can i get a refill of that ? [doctor] yes , absolutely . so take 1 tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you're eating and drinking about like what makes it worse . [patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas . [doctor] okay , good and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time , just plan on drinking plenty of water . [patient] okay . [doctor] okay and you can take it but before you do , we wan na try to reduce the triggers so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks . [patient] okay , i can do that . okay . and so however , if it is not just these isolated incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long-term medication that would take that you would take every night . [doctor] and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ? [patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether . [doctor] yeah , there is and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ? [patient] that sounds like a much better plan . [doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that just take it every night before bedtime . [patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay . [patient] okay , that sounds good , thank you . [doctor] you're welcome and have a good rest of your day . so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan , brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 mg at bedtime for ibs . she can use bentyl 20 mg as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed , however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in 1 month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects of issues or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .","

virtscribe,VS019,"[patient] next patient is emily hernandez , date of birth march 26 , 2001 . this is a 20-year-old female being seen today for her yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer , and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms . which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy . she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation . hi emily , how are you ? [doctor] i'm pretty good . how are you ? [patient] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago , and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? [doctor] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using . [patient] okay and that's the 250 50 dose , correct ? [doctor] yes , correct . [patient] perfect . so how does that compare ? [doctor] i mean it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night . [patient] and that's 1 puff twice a day . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] okay and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? [doctor] rarely and if i do , it's really just before a workout or something like that if i know i'm really gon na be pushing it . [patient] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . [doctor] yes . [patient] okay . so you can do things like going to walk or going to the grocery store , no problem and just use it for more exertional stuff . [doctor] yes like if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon . [patient] no kidding , that's great . [doctor] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler . [patient] really ? [doctor] yeah and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler , it makes it easier . [patient] and so my inhaler , do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [doctor] mm-hmm so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test and then they'll see how the asthma affects me and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less and really some days i feel like i do n't need it . [patient] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week , do you use 1 puff in the morning and 1 puff at night ? [doctor] probably about three or four . [patient] okay , 3 to 4 days/week and the other days , it's once a day ? [doctor] yes , that's correct . [patient] okay . [doctor] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it . [patient] okay , do you think that's working okay ? [doctor] i do . [patient] great and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? [doctor] nope . [patient] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then ? [doctor] nope . [patient] okay and now military wise , what's the timeframe of when you be completing some of these exertional tests , like what are your next steps ? [doctor] so hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring 2022 so that gives me about 6 to 7 months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler or at least show them that i have it under control . [patient] now when you were in the other room , you completed a breathing test , correct ? correct . okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , because i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer , and fall , correct ? [doctor] yeah , i do n't really or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall , i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer . [patient] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [doctor] yeah , that's right . [patient] okay , and have you been taking the zyrtec everyday recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? not every day , but i do take it on days . i know i'm going to be outside a lot . i do tend to work outside about 3 days a week , so i'll definitely take it on those days . and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [doctor] yeah , it does , it works great . [patient] wonderful , good to hear and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts , last year you had told me it worked with you worked with enterprise , renocard and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives when you had touched it , is that correct ? [doctor] yep , that's correct . [patient] okay and has there been anything like that since that experience ? no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that . so i usually wear , i wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now , so i have n't had a reaction but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that have peanuts in them . [doctor] but they just did n't touch my skin . [patient] super and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [doctor] yeah , in the airplanes , they have peanuts , they give everyone too , so . [patient] okay and you have an epipen that you that you keep with you , correct ? [doctor] yes . [patient] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course they expire within a year . [doctor] yeah , okay . [patient] and i remember sometime previously you had had some testing for tree nuts but you do have almonds and cashews correct and and you do okay with them or do you avoid all tree nuts . [doctor] i do tend to avoid all of them , but i recall eating some almonds at one point really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i remember having them and nothing happened but i usually just tend to stay away from them really if i can help it . [patient] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , [doctor] so it is very common to avoid both . so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great , we can work on getting you something lower than wixela , [patient] if you look at all our asthma regimens , it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one , and well maybe you do n't need both of them . maybe you just need one of them , so we can work our way backwards . [doctor] okay . [patient] and so the breathing test will help give us some more guidance , so we will look at the results in just a moment . [doctor] alright and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , [patient] but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good and now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit , so i am sure that might have an effect . it can . so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results probably before you started smoking or using the vape . [doctor] okay . [patient] yeah , and we will see where you stand at that point . [doctor] alright , that sounds good . well , lem me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth , a big ah , a ah . [patient] good . okay . let me take a peek in your nose . alright , good . you can put your mask back on . okay . and go ahead , take a big breath in and out . good . your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart . breathe quietly . okay . very good . [doctor] awesome . so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple of years ago , it actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember , but when we last completed the test in 2019 , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ? i think it was a smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking up the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke . [patient] yes , you're absolutely right . that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here is what i think . so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ? [doctor] correct . [patient] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use . [doctor] yeah , i do know that . okay , so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day . so that's an option . [patient] option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco though is that it would be 2 puffs in the morning and 2 puffs at night , so it's a bit more work . it's not breath activated , but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that we're published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill or say during smoke season so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting yellow or sick , having issues every month , then that would indicate we'd pull back too much that would have too much , yeah . okay . so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers when you're ill or at smoke season , but if the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco . [doctor] okay , that actually sounds really good . [patient] okay , great . so i will call that in for you . it will be the lower dose 80 mcg and you will have to do 2 puffs twice a day . [doctor] alright . [patient] okay and that will be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you . [doctor] okay . got it . [patient] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in 4 months to see how you're doing and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests . [doctor] okay . [patient] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ? [doctor] yeah , i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser promonte , broadway . [patient] okay , perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well . [doctor] awesome , thank you . [patient] you're welcome . then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or you do get , do you get it as a prescription ? [doctor] i just get it over the counter . [patient] okay , got it and do you have a nebulizer that you would need refills on ? i do n't think i need any refills . i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis or there was a few select times when i had to use it when i was a kid . okay , good . well , i think we have our game plan . [doctor] okay , awesome . [patient] and do the alvesco 2 puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it , the zyrtec 10 mg as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen . [doctor] okay . [patient] alright , so we've got it . [doctor] great . [patient] alright , i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say 4 months , recheck for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer , spirometry at that time . [doctor] okay , sounds good . [patient] alright , well , thanks so much and you have a great day . [doctor] you too . and we will do a follow-up in 4 months with a ct and spirometry sooner if needed . follow up 25 minutes .","

virtscribe,VS025,"[doctor] okay , so our next patient is christopher watson , date of birth 4/12/1934 . mr . watson is a 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing shunt shunt surgery , excuse me , in august 1 , 2020 . i have followed mr . watson since may 2020 when he first presented with 8 to 10 years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control , we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spinal catheter protocol in june 2020 and he underwent shunt shunt surgery on august 1 , 2020 . medtronic strata programmical shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration was programmed at a level of 2.0 was placed . good morning mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ? [patient] hi document this is my daughter theresa , she is the one who helps me keep things straight . [doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hospitalized since your shunt shunt surgery 3 months ago ? [patient] not that i recall . no , he has n't . he has been doing much better . [doctor] good . i'm glad to hear that . before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ? his walking has improved . he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him . [patient] that's impressive mr . watson ? [doctor] yeah , i guess . now his bladder control did improve some after surgery but now seems to have leveled out , so he is wearing diapers . [patient] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper and any decreased or painful urination ? [doctor] no , not at all . and how about cognition ? [patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore . [doctor] dan and i both think my sister , hannah summarized it best . she said i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again . not so wonderful . now , have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ? [patient] no , has n't bothered me 1 bit . [doctor] okay and any pain in your belly at all ? [patient] ca n't say that i have . [doctor] okay . sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm gon na step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that alright ? [patient] sounds good . [doctor] okay . i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month and then we will chat about it when i come in . alrighty mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though , i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . [patient] now i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan . [doctor] what does that mean ? just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another 2 to 3 months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved , so that's all good for me . so really there is , there is nothing to worry about . alright , so i'll come back in 3 months . [patient] yep , that's right . [doctor] i do have a question for you though . [patient] yeah , of course . [doctor] do you think i will be able to drive again ? man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point , it's unlikely that your movement , speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver's safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me . by improving over a 9 to 12-month range and that , that definitely could be you , you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that , then you know i think it could be possible , and i would be happy to recommend it . now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation , so you could kind of do that preemptively and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go . [patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask i do n't like to burn anyone when i just need to run to the store , but i also know that i need to be safe . [doctor] yeah , your safety is our # 1 priority and you know i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right ? they wan na keep you here and have you safe , but i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . [patient] and so i'm sure when we talked again in 3 months , we'll continue to be on that upper trajectory of improvement . [doctor] i sure hope so don . [patient] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment upfront ? [doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls upfront will take care of you and get you settled for 3 months from now and you both take care , alright ? [patient] thanks .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
 watson is an 86-year-old male who returns for a follow-up of adult hydrocephalus. He underwent shunt shunt surgery on august 1, 2020. He is doing well since then, but there is still a bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region. His bladder control has improved slightly since the surgery, but he is still reliant on diapers. I have recommended that we continue to monitor him for another 2 to 3 months before we go in and change the shunt. cognitive impairment, decreased bladder control, and decreased urination have not improved. He still has times where I have to help him to get up and down the stairs. He does not feel like he is able to talk effectively at this time, but I think he is doing better now. We discussed that he should continue to engage in regular conversations with his family and friends. I also advised him to continue to watch his weight, activity, and blood pressure. I am going to refer him to physical therapy to help strengthen his lower extremities. The patient will follow up with me in 3 months to check on his progress. If his weight continues to increase, we may need to consider performing a cardiac catheterization"
virtscribe-7,VS036,"[doctor] tyler nelson , date of birth 3/6/1949 , mrn 385729 . he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis . last time he was here he received a steroid injection in his right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ? [patient] about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen . [doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection , did it help ? [patient] it did maybe for a couple of weeks . [doctor] that's it and is it still painful ? [patient] yeah , it's pretty painful and now the whole leg is getting swollen . [doctor] okay . what would you say your pain level is ? [patient] i mean right now it's about a three or so but typically on the normal day , it's around six . [doctor] okay and it's been swollen like that for how long now ? [patient] since i was last here a couple of weeks after that , so about maybe 2 months now . [doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ? [patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time but it has n't been helping . [doctor] okay . okay . so that has n't been working for you . [patient] i mean it helps to some degree but it's still swollen especially around the knee . [doctor] hmmm has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ? [patient] well i slowed down a little bit and i try to do things too fast but when it really hurts is when i've been sitting for a while and then i try to get up . i'm so stiff getting up , i have to use a cane to get my bearings i mean after a little bit it loosens up but at first getting up is really difficult . [doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? you're on xeljanz , right ? [patient] yeah , the xr i think it's 11 mg a day , yeah , but i'm taking it everyday and i'm also taking celebrex , which i started maybe 2 months ago . [doctor] yeah , the 200 mix daily . how is that working for you ? [patient] pretty good up until this started swelling again . [doctor] okay well come sit over here and if you could take off your socks and shoes and we will take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit so you'll hear , hear me call things out and describe what i see fully . okay , gotcha . [patient] right , so let's check your leg , can you straighten it and does it hurt ? yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way , it does . [doctor] okay . range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here ? hmmm i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ? [patient] just like an old bruise . [doctor] so i can feel that the knee is hot and that means there is something going on like some inflammation so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee so we can see where all the swelling is coming from . yeah sounds good to me . [patient] okay and do we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ? [doctor] no i was doing some years ago , but that was the other knee . okay so i think we will set that up for you now . we will also do an x-ray on that knee i can send you for a physical therapy and if nothing is helping then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee . [patient] okay . sounds like a plan . [doctor] alright , so for today , we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless . [patient] okay and that's the procedure you're gon na do right now ? [doctor] yep once we're done talking here and as far as the edema in your legs , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can . do as well . the compression socks are a good start and also do you eat a lot of salt ? [patient] i mean i , i mean i love my salty snacks . [doctor] okay . well salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up anytime you get a chance especially at night . [patient] and have you talked to your primary care doctor about this at all ? no , i think i would just come here first . okay . so i think try some of those things out first and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them . [doctor] also as you know xeljanz is a high risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months so this time your levels are good but you make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time . [patient] alright i can do that . thank you so much doc . [doctor] yes of course well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee . fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained including but not limited to hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures and transient hyperglycemia among others . verbal consent was obtained . the right knee was accessed through the lateral approach with 3 ml of initially clear fluid , then blood . blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 mg of triamcin alone . and 1 ml of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well with no complications . post procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .","

RESULTS

X-ray of the right knee taken in office today reveals some pitting around the knee and ankle. There is some capillary refill in the toes. The area is hot and that means there is some inflammation. The range of motion is slightly diminished. The patient is on xeljanz 11 mg a day and takes celebrex 200 mg daily. If nothing is helping, he might need to get a surgery consult. The doctor will write a note about the visit in order to set up physical therapy in case the arthritis doesn't improve in the next few days. He will let the patient know about it.
ASSESSMENT AND PLANTyler Nelson is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis. His right knee is still swollen. He received a steroid injection in his right knee approximately 2 months ago. The previous time he was here he had a lower extremity MRI. The patient states that the previous MRI did not reveal any concerning signs of arthritis. We discussed treatment options today, including continued steroid injection. He will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his pain level, swelling, and x-ray. We will also send him for a physical therapy referral. If his symptoms do not improve, we may need to consider a second steroid injection or surgery consult. He is currently taking Xeljanz 11 mg daily, ibuprofen 200 mg, Tylenol 2 mg, and Flexeril 2 mg daily. He should also continue to eat salt and salt-based foods, as prescribed, and drink plenty of fluids. Physical therapy should be provided as needed to help strengthen his lower extremities. "
